<h2>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h2>


<p>The great demand for <span class="smcap">Practical Carriage and Wagon Painting</span>
has already exhausted the second edition, and orders are arriving in increasing
numbers every day. The publisher wishes to express his grateful
thanks to the trade for the generous patronage accorded the work. Not
only would we express our thanks to those who have purchased the book,
but we feel deeply grateful to the trade press for the generous reviews and
kindly expressions of approval that they have given the volume. We send
the third edition forth with the conviction that it is an improvement over
the old ones in many respects, although we think the other editions were
well worth the price charged for them.</p>

<p>It has been almost twenty years since a volume on carriage and wagon
painting made its appearance in this country, during which time the enterprising
carriage painter has been wide awake. He has found many new
processes and a multitude of new materials of which the workman of twenty
years ago knew nothing; he has raised vehicle painting from a simple mechanical
process, which was intended to preserve the surface from decay, to
a fine art of the highest order, and fashionable people now take as much
pride in having beautiful and stylish equipages as they do in wearing clothing
that is up to date, or in securing jewels that are sufficiently brilliant to
dazzle all beholders.</p>

<p>No one realized more fully than the writer that an up-to-date work on
the difficult but noble calling of the carriage and wagon painter was badly
needed, so he began to cast about for someone who was fully qualified for
the task of writing such a book. He knew that the author of such a work
should be a man of extended trade practice and one who could divest himself
of high-flown scientific terms and make his language so plain that any
workman who cared to do so could easily comprehend the instruction given.
A careful survey of the field led to the selection of Mr. M. C. Hillick, whose
work for the magazines during the past ten or twelve years has done so
much to assist carriage and wagon painters to elevate their calling to its
present high standard. Mr. Hillick has long held a high place among the
best-known carriage painters in this country, is thoroughly posted on all
the various branches of the business, and has the happy faculty of being able
to impart his knowledge to others in such a plain, practical way that they
cannot fail to understand him. His excessive modesty came very near causing
him to decline, but he was finally induced to undertake the work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Practical Carriage and Wagon Painting</span> is presented to a generous
public with the knowledge that its superior has never made its appearance
in this country.</p>

<p>It is but a short time since the demands of the times gave birth to that
great institution&mdash;the factory shop&mdash;that monster establishment from which
hundreds of vehicles are turned out daily. The writer pleads guilty to a
strong prejudice against the class of work done in these factories, yet he is
compelled to admire the finished product and applaud the genius of the
painter who can thus marshal his forces and, by working to a set of fixed
rules, seem to defy natural laws, and out of it all bring a thing of beauty
which, while it does not prove a "joy forever," does possess a degree of
durability that we of the old school of carriage painters were led to believe
was impossible. It has remained for Mr. Hillick to take us through this
great establishment, and he describes the processes and gives us the formulas
that are employed, in such plain, helpful language, that no one can
read his words without profit as well as pleasure.</p>

<p>Time and space forbid (even if I had the ability to give it) a comprehensive
review of this work. It would be impossible to enumerate the millions
of good points it possesses, so it is best to let the succeeding pages
speak for themselves. They will do it much more eloquently than I could
hope to do. I am sure of one fact, and it is that if carriage and wagon
painters all over the world will read and practice the teachings of the succeeding
chapters they will become better painters, better citizens, and our
country roads, as well as our boulevards, will sparkle with a stream of better
painted and more beautiful vehicles.</p>

<p>When the writing of <span class="smcap">Practical Carriage and Wagon Painting</span>
was committed to Mr. Hillick, the writer expected great things of him.
Now, as I look over the chapters of the completed work, I am happily conscious
of the fact that I am not disappointed in the slightest degree, and I
wish to thank Mr. Hillick for giving to the vehicle world a work on painting
that will prove helpful to the master workman as well as to the ambitious
apprentice.</p>

<h2><em>INTRODUCTORY.</em></h2>


<p class="dropcap">In many of its elementary principles the art of carriage and wagon painting
as at present exemplified does not materially differ from the art as it
was interpreted in the remote past. Processes and systems have
changed and adapted themselves to the swifter modes of life, but not a few
of the paint materials, especially those used in the foundation and surfacing
coats, remain practically the same as used in former times. The P. W. F.'s,
as surfacing agents expected to take the place of white lead and oil and their
assistant pigments, tossed merrily upon the topmost wave of favor for a
brief period some two decades ago, but the fiat of their decline went forth
and at the present time the great majority of carriage and wagon painters
still adhere to white lead, raw linseed oil, ochres, and regulation roughstuff
pigments for their foundation materials, as did their instructors and
predecessors.</p>

<p>The abbreviated time allowance accorded the painter for the painting
and finishing of a vehicle has made necessary a readjustment of proportions
of both liquid and pigment ingredients which, it must be confessed, has
operated in a way harmful to the natural durability of the material employed.
The painter, however, can in no wise be held responsible for the general
lack of durability which is said to distinguish the painting of the present as
compared to that of the past. The great inexorable Public is the master,
the painter its unwilling but submissive servant.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, conditions of permanency and durability are still wrought
and achieved in the modern field of carriage and wagon painting, conditions
which conform, with a large measure of credit to the art of painting, to the
other resultant durable effects obtained along nearly all other lines of
industrial activity.</p>

<p>Our painting today fails to excel the painting of tradition simply
because the exactions of a wonderfully fast age tend directly to promote
failure rather than to aid success.</p>

<p>The job of painting which withstands fierce and continuous attacks of
service for a reasonable length of time must be justly registered durable,
regardless of what it would have been termed in the past. Past conditions
and circumstances cannot fairly be used as yardsticks to measure what we
at present call beautiful and enduring in the art of painting.</p>

<p>In the matter of tools, appliances for handling work, colors and
varnishes used, carriage and wagon painting, amid the advances made in all
the other constructive departments of industry, has enjoyed improvement.
Brushes in greater variety, finer in quality, and better adapted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
practical needs of the painter, are in evidence. Colors of a wider range of
hues, tints, shades, and incomparably finer as to quality than were obtainable
formerly, are now at the disposal of the painter. And the varnishes&mdash;surely
they have been improved, made more reliable, more uniform in
quality, better behaved and more suited to the ever-varying requirements of
service.</p>

<p>Carnage and wagon painting has become as much of a business as an
artistic venture. Commercial conditions have of late years so shaped
themselves that the painter, to successfully conduct a painting business,
must of necessity study the profound science of business quite as thoroughly
as he does the science of building paint structures and developing color
effects. He imparts a moral, business, and mechanical force to the community.
He now has available sources of education more easily within his
reach than at any former time. Paint trade literature, so far as it is
represented in magazine form at least, is at hand to render him aid and
encouragement. He is rapidly becoming better fitted to meet the expanding
limits of competition, to critically analyze both the theory and practice of
painting, to become, in short, a greater power for good in the community as
well as a studious and original mechanic.</p>

<p>In the inseparable community of business interests, the painting of the
vehicular equipment has reached the level of a prominent industry.</p>

<p>Its chief attainments are, firstly, to preserve the structural parts of the
vehicle from the action of the elements; secondly, from the remorseless and
gnawing tooth of service; thirdly, to aid in making the vehicle really
beautiful, a work of art.</p>

<p>The mission of the following chapters will be to record the systems,
methods, and processes practiced in modern carriage and wagon painting, to
the end that the apprentice&mdash;good luck to him, and may he pluck the peach
from the sunniest side of the fence always&mdash;may be enlightened, that the
already skilled workman may be interested somewhat, and that the trade of
carriage and wagon painting may be welcomed as a delightful guest, worthy
of enthusiastic entertainment.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It would not be fit nor seemly to lay down any arbitrary rules for the
guidance of the painter in the selection or construction of the paint
shop. Conditions and circumstances here control. But so far as the
painter is able to have authority in the matter it should be directed in favor
of large, roomy apartments, high ceilings, and a fine outfit of windows.
Light is an indispensable commodity in the paint shop. And room&mdash;there
is never an excess of it. To do good work at a profit invokes an easy,
commodious working space. To this end,
therefore, the painter may well direct his best
endeavors. Nor should the ventilation be
neglected. A ventilator in quite common use,
old-time but effective when the construction of
the shop permits of its use, consists of the
regulation stove pipe, say 12 inches in diameter
and extending 18
inches or 2 feet above
the roof of the building,
furnished at its upper
extremity with a revolving
hood or cap. The
local tinsmith usually
has an invention of his
own in the way of revolving
ventilators which is workable and nicely suited to
the needs of the paint shop. Where ceiling ventilators
are not practicable, apertures some 8 inches in diameter
may be made in the walls well up toward the ceiling, one
or two on each side of the room, according to the size and
location, and into these apertures insert tin frames,
both ends of which are covered with wire gauze, the
gauze on the inside or room end of the fixture being
fitted to a hinged lid frame. Into this tin and gauze
compartment put clean curled hair or moss. Metal
caps may be fitted to cover the inside opening of these
ventilators, so that if necessary the air can be shut out
entirely so far as entrance through these channels is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
concerned. There are numerous other styles of ventilators, but they do not
call for mention, as local and individual needs will suggest the kind most
feasible to adopt.</p>

<p>The mixing bench should be located in a light corner
of the room. It should be furnished with a slab of marble
or stone, preferably marble. A cupboard with tightly
fitting doors should be over, or at the side of, the bench

boards on which to wipe
brushes near at hand. A
first-class paint mill should
be a fixture in close proximity

<p>The varnish room (sacred
temple of the painter's hopes
shall we say?), over which
men rarely fail to disagree,
needs to be every inch as
large as conditions will permit. It should have ventilators, such as above
described or similar, in plenty. The gauze and tin funnel ventilators might
well be used near the floor and ceiling, thus driving the room impurities up
and out. The varnish room cannot well be too large, nor too light, nor too
cosy. Nor can it follow too closely the Quaker's code as to furnishings, for
"unadorned, adorned the most" strictly applies to this historic apartment.
It is agreed that the northeast corner of the shop is the best location for the
varnish room. The north light is the most restful and the easiest light to
work by, and it is esteemed the best drying light. The room ought not to
be placed immediately over the smith shop. It should have plenty of
windows, north and east, and made to lower at the top. If possible, have a
hardwood floor, and oiled, with ceiling and side walls of matched lumber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
good quality and preferably painted white or some very light color, that it
will reflect the light. Personally, I am in favor of blue colored shades for
north windows and yellow ones for east and west windows. If possible,
connect a "set room," provided with abundance of light, with the varnish
room, into which the work may be removed the morning after finishing.
The varnish room requires a small cupboard for holding varnish, cups,
dusters, brushes, chamois skins, sponges, etc., a body trestle or two, a few
wooden, low-cut horses for supporting the varnished work, a stove, if the
shop be not heated by other means, a sliding door or two, and&mdash;that's all.</p>

<p>The work-handling appliances here furnished have been observed,
studied, and many of them used by the writer in his travels up and down
the land of paint shops. The revolving wheel jack is an indispensable
fixture in the paint shop. <a href="#Fig_1_01">Fig. 1</a> has a plank base, and an axle for a
standard. The cut shows how it is made. Many shops use it.<a href="#Fig_1_02"> Fig. 2</a> is
frequently seen in provincial paint shops. It consists of a hardwood scantling
of the size noted in the cut, with a <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>-inch or <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>-inch round iron stuck
into one end and projecting 7 inches out. A hole to nicely take the iron is
bored through the floor into a joist, a floor plate is placed over it, and the
upright is ready to revolve. A tapering piece of round iron <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch at the
base is driven through the upper end of the standard, having a projection of
7 or 8 inches. A thick metal washer is then slipped over the arm, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
completing the fixture. <a href="#Fig_1_03">Fig. 3</a> is largely used in factory shops. It is the
finest wheel jack extant. Observe the bottom. Almost any foundry will
cast one at from $1.25 to $1.50 each. Weight, from 40 to 60 lbs.; diameter,
18 to 20 inches; hole for insertion of arm, 1 inch to <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> inches. Weld stub
axle to the round arm. Have varying sizes of axle stubs, from <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>, <span class="fnum">7</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>, and
1 inch to <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> inches. This is a particularly fine jack for wheel striping
purposes. Can be easily transferred to any part of the shop, and runs true.</p>

<p>The Long-Acre body trestle, a London production, is often met with in
the paint shop. <a href="#Fig_1_04">Fig. 4</a> shows it in working order, on rollers, and the
wheels connected with a wooden pin for a pivot. <a href="#Fig_1_05">Fig. 5</a> is a second body
trestle, neat, easy to work, and the cut quite completely explains how it is
built. Height, and proportion of parts can be made to suit the individual
fancy. <a href="#Fig_1_06">Fig. 6</a> represents a combination body and gear trestle largely used
in factory paint shops. Height, 3 ft., 2 in.; length of revolving frame pieces,
27 in., 2×2 in. in size. A 4×4 inch piece 9 in. long supports the frame.
Inclined pieces are 25 in. long; size, 2×2 in. The trestle is of hardwood,
or should be, bolted together. <a href="#Fig_1_07">Fig. 7</a>, a gear frame, fits onto the frame of
<a href="#Fig_1_06">Fig. 6</a>. It should be 4 ft., 6 in. long and 14 in. wide. It easily takes the
shortest gears as well as the longest, and the workman is enabled to always
obtain the best possible light. <a href="#Fig_1_08">Fig. 8</a> is a seat frame made to fit the trestle,
<a href="#Fig_1_06">Fig. 6</a>. Make it of 1-inch stuff. Length, 2 ft.; height at rear, 9 in.; front,
2 in.; width, <span class="nowrap">13 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> in., to fit frame. This holds a carriage seat in capital
shape for painting and finishing. <a href="#Fig_1_09">Fig. 9</a> is a frame for holding bodies while
varnishing them or while rubbing the varnish. One-inch pine boards 6 in.
in width afford good material for the frame. Let it be from 32 to 36 in.
high, about the same in length, and 27 in. wide. At top of standards bolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
7×1-inch pieces 6 in. long, containing steel brads to hold the work in place.
<a href="#Fig_1_10">Fig. 10</a> is a horse for holding carriage gears during the process of painting
and finishing. Gear horses can't all be revolving ones, and this one is
strong and handy to work around. Make the legs of 3×<span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> pine or ash and
the bed piece, to which the iron standards are bolted, of ash 3×3 inches.
Bolt the legs to the bed piece and stay them in the middle. The iron
standards, <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">16</span> in. thick and <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> in. wide, are cranked over at right angles, as
shown in cut, bolted firmly to bed piece, and at upper ends are hollowed out
to hold the axle arms. Height of horse, 30 to 34 inches; width, wide
enough to take a gear from 4 ft. to 5 ft., 4 in. Let the iron standards go 30
inches long, cranked at the middle. A rubbing deck for roughstuff and
varnish rubbing, washing up work, etc., is a necessity even in the small
shop. <a href="#Fig_1_11">Fig. 11</a> explains an inexpensive one. A A is the shop floor, D the
wall, B B the false or double floor inclining to the
center, where a shallow metal gutter is let into the
floor opening to a waste pipe which conveys all the
waste matter outside the shop. The outer edges of
the double floor rest upon stoutly-secured blocks of
wood. <a href="#Fig_1_12">Fig. 12</a> shows an
asphalt or cement rubbing
deck in general use in many
leading shops. G is the
shop wall, F the waste
pipe, E the deck. The
asphalt deck is not an expensive
fixture, neither
wears nor rusts out, and,
like <a href="#Fig_1_11">Fig. 11</a>, is a practical
time saver. And along
with the rubbing deck the
painter should adopt measures for securing a plentiful supply of clean soft
water for shop uses, and, if possible, have it piped directly to the rubbing
deck. These are days of hard-fought business battles, and any aid that will
out-foot one's competitor is an effective aid. A good water supply right at
hand helps mightily. <a href="#Fig_1_13">Fig. 13</a> is a deck barrel for holding a ready supply of
water for the rubber; also for holding certain styles of carriage and cutter
bodies while rubbing. The slit cut at an angle lets a buggy, surrey, or other
carriage seat in, and holds it fast while the rubbing proceeds.</p>

<p>The varnish room stove, when one is forced to use such a fixture, gives
the painter much concern. In <a href="#Fig_1_14">Fig. 14</a> is to be observed a way of enclosing
the stove in sheet-iron, after the fashion of the railroads once upon a time.
Cut an opening in the wall separating the varnish room from some one of
the other apartments, set the stove just inside the varnish room, inclose it
in the sheet-iron cylinder, making the cylinder fit close into the wall opening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and have the opening to the stove, and the stove door, reached from the
room adjoining the varnish room. Even when wholly located in the varnish
room such a cylinder, enclosing the stove all over, is a practical reducer of
stove dirt, etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">BUYING AND SELECTING BRUSHES&mdash;CARE OF THEM&mdash;SOFTENING HARD
BRUSHES&mdash;BRUSH KEEPERS&mdash;PRESERVING LIQUIDS&mdash;BRUSHES USED
IN VEHICLE PAINTING, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">One conspicuously famous brush maker has declared the art of brush
making to be "an art preservative." The carriage and wagon
painter is deeply concerned in the achievements of that art, because
every distinct advancement made therein makes possible an equally distinct
advancement in the art of painting. To a greater extent, perhaps, than
any other class of painters, the carriage and wagon painter should be interested
in making up his brush equipment of tools of the best quality. The brush
made of reliable stock, having the proper "hang" and point, and which
balances like a "thoroughbred," is an economical tool to buy, regardless of
the price. The vehicle painter requires a brush made scientifically, by the
outlay of honest workmanship, and of material that is wholly above suspicion.
A brush that has simply the price to recommend it is usually an
unreliable article and worketh evil, like a thief in the night, unexpectedly.
In making choice of a brush for putting on priming, lead, and roughstuff,
and for such other features of general use as require a round or oval bristle
brush, the painter may properly look at the filling of the tool. Deception,
if practiced at all, is usually placed where it shows the least. The first-class
brush is distinctively the brush that shows good quality&mdash;uniform quality&mdash;from
center to outside. Other things
being equal, the brush that is made
up uniformly as to its bristle equipment
will develop a good point, and
all carriage painters are alive to the
importance of this virtue in both paint
and varnish brushes.</p>

<p>Much of the usefulness of a brush
depends upon the manner of caring for
it when it comes into the paint shop.
The bristle brushes used for priming,
lead, and roughstuff require bridling
until worn down somewhat. There
are many patent brush bridles now
procurable at a nominal cost which
tend to give a brush much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shape than the shop-made bridle. If these are not at hand, the painter can
take "tufting cord" (our friends, the carriage trimmers, keep it) and wind
the brush securely but not too tightly; or he can take a piece of light weight
rubber cloth and, extending the piece well down on the handle, tie it at the
proper distance around the bristles. The rubber side of the piece should be
fastened next the bristles. Then, from where it is tied around the bristles,
fold the piece back onto the handle and tie securely. Trim off, and a bridle
is furnished that is perfectly water- and paint-proof, the cloth side of the
rubber being folded inside. For a shop-made bridle the writer finds this a
serviceable one. After bridling, drop a little oil paint into the heel of the
brush and set it away in a dustproof compartment for a few days. Then
use the brush for a time in oil paint, suspending the brush when not in use
in raw linseed oil. In the course of two or three days
the brush may be put into other paint if desired and
suspended in water. Suspend the brush just up to
the butts of the bristles, or so they are just covered,
and invariably keep the water up to that point.
Under no circumstances permit a brush to rest upon its
point when not in use. It destroys the form of the
tool and lessens its spring and elasticity. The bristle
paint brushes require a clean storage quite to the
extent that the color or varnish brushes do. Therefore,
the receptacle in which they are kept should be
fitted with a cover and should be tight enough to keep
out all forms of dirt. A common tobacco pail procured
of the local grocery, painted inside and out,
fitted with a cover, and having nails driven at certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
distances apart all around it, one-third of the way down from the top, on
which the brushes may be suspended, makes a cheap and excellent keeper
for the ordinary paint brushes.</p>

<p>Camel's hair color brushes may well have a little
paint, one-half oil and one-half turpentine, dropped
into the heels of them. These brushes, used in japan
ground colors, need to be kept suspended in water.
Change the water frequently and make sure that it is
clean. A brush keeper such as is recommended for
varnish brushes is one of the best possible keepers for
color brushes. It insures cleanliness. And vehicle
painting without cleanliness is like unto a landscape
painting with the beauties of nature left out. The
brushes kept in water do better in rain water than in
hard water. During the cold months, especially in
shops where freezing is liable to occur, it is advisable
to add a little glycerine to the water. The glycerine
delays the freezing point and does not injure the
brushes. Never soak a brush in water before using it
in paint. Animal fat circulates in the capillary tubes
of all bristles and hair, and if water
is soaked into these arteries, the
spring and elasticity of the brush is
not only destroyed, but it speedily
becomes a very much water-logged tool. To swell up a
brush which for some cause has become dried out and
shrunken, part the bristles so that the end of the handle
is exposed, and pour in a small quantity of water, say
three or four teaspoonfuls. Then stand it away, bristles
up, handle down, for two or three hours and the brush will
have returned to its normal condition. If a brush handle
gets smeared with paint or varnish, a wire scrub brush
dipped in a solution of sal soda will clean off the sticky
substance in short order. To test the bristles in a brush,
remove some of them and submit them to a smart flame.
Bristles, the real animal product, will curl and writhe and
emit a peculiar odor. No known adulterant burns this way.</p>

</div>

<p>A brush that has been allowed through accident or
neglect to get "soggy" may be limbered up nicely by
soaking in heated turpentine. Hardened brushes may
often be softened into workable condition again by soaking
the bristles in hot linseed oil. A simple soaking in turps or benzine
will sometimes effect the needed softening up. Brushes, however, that have
dried up, saturated with quick drying colors or paint, can at best never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
restored to a first-class working condition. The best form
of economy, therefore, is to throw such brushes away.
Remedies in impressive array have been marshalled wherewith
to restore varnish brushes that have become lousy,
but the vehicle finisher recognizes no reliable or economical
remedy for the purpose named. A dirty varnish
brush can be cleaned by washing in oil first, then in
turps, and lastly worked in for putting on first rubbing
coats, and thus gradually brought back to its original
cleanliness. But the varnish brush once lousy, look you!
<em>always</em> lousy. Better</p>

<p>When a varnish brush is accidentally dropped on the
floor while being used, pick
it up carefully and, holding
it at an acute angle, bristles
down, pour a small quantity
of turpentine over it, thus flooding the accumulated
dirt completely off.</p>

<p>There is a considerable diversity of opinion as to
the best preserving liquid in which to keep the varnish
brushes. Local needs and requirements are probably
the safest guides in the matter of choosing preserving
liquids for varnish brushes. When the brushes
are used daily, as they are in big shops, it is a very
good way to keep them in raw linseed oil. Then,
every morning before beginning
work, the brushes
may be rinsed out in turpentine,
wiped out clearly
over the edge of the cup, and an elastic brush full of life
is assured.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Badger-Hair Flowing Brush.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Brushes used daily upon clean surfaces are, or should
be, clean, and rinsing in turpentine can do no harm to a
clean brush. But in the case of brushes used every two
or three days or occasionally, different treatment is
needed. Such brushes are liable to be used upon surfaces
and amid surroundings less cleanly than those which
obtain in the fine factory or custom shop, and the rinsing
in turps, consequent upon preserving them in oil, would
merely serve to loosen and set in motion the dirt and
flocculent matter gradually collected and forced up into
the body of the tools. For this reason it were better to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
keep them in finishing varnish or, preferably, brush keeping varnish, i. e.,
varnish minus its driers. Whatever the preservative, the brushes require
the most watchful attention. If kept in finishing varnish, the liquid should
be changed frequently. So delicate a tool, of
which so much is expected, makes imperative
the observance of gentle, cleanly treatment.
Varnish brushes ought never to be left lying
around for any considerable length of time when
not in use. Dust is never idle, but always moving
and, like the dew of the evening, it falleth
upon the just and the unjust, varnish brushes
included. Have a stiff, partly-worn brush to
clean the handles of varnish brushes. Wiping
them with cloth distributes lint.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_2_01">Fig. 1</a> is shown a double compartment
brush keeper. It can be made of tin or zinc and
is not expensive. Attach lock and key to it, and
the brushes conditioned to a peerless trim are
secure. Make the keeper 8 in. long, 5 in. wide,
9 in. deep; outfit with spring fasteners, run wires
through 3 in. from top, and <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> in. from bottom
of the can locate a rack made of
small wires criss-crossed on a
light wire frame. The dirt
which collects in the keeper goes to the bottom beneath the
gauze rack, and should a brush fall into the preserving
liquid it is held aloof from the dirt accumulations. These
are regulation brush keepers, clean, durable, and cost in the
neighborhood of $1. <a href="#Fig_2_02">Fig. 2</a> represents the famous thirty-cent
brush keeper, several times illustrated but still deserving
a place here. It is claimed to be made upon scientific principles,
namely, the break between the body of the keeper
and its lid or cover occurs at the bottom and below the
point of brush suspension, instead, as in the ordinary
keeper, at the top and above the point of suspension. It
can be made of any size to meet individual needs. Such a
can affords a splendid keeper for camel's-hair color brushes
and for color-and-varnish brushes. <a href="#Fig_2_03">Fig. 3</a> displays what
has been somewhat widely heralded as the western idea of a
brush keeper, although the gentleman who first published a
cut of the keeper and who, I believe, was the inventor of it,
has seldom, if ever, been given credit for his ingenuity. My veteran brother
of the brush, Mr. V. B. Grinnell, is deserving of the thanks of the trade for
his invention. It consists of an ordinary glass fruit can (a metal top with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
rubber attachment is best), in which is located a tin cup,
having a heavy wire soldered to it and projecting up to
near the top of the can. This allows the cup to be easily
removed from the top of the can. A second wire is soldered
onto the first one so that it projects out horizontally over the
cup, allowing for the suspension of the brushes in the liquid
contained in the cup. The illustration shows how the keeper
is made completely. Two or three brushes may be kept in
each can, and they may be kept air-tight, too, a matter of
moment to the vehicle painter.</p>

<p>The vehicle painter's brush equipment should consist of
a good assortment of round or oval bristle brushes for putting
on priming, lead, and roughstuff. For the best grade of
carriage painting, the chiseled brush is advised for the priming
and lead coats. In size they should run about 4.0. For
working upon large surfaces, however, larger brushes will be
needed, hence any exact size cannot be advised to meet all
cases. Spoke brushes, dusters in plenty, flat chiseled bristle
paint brushes, extra thick camel's-hair color brushes, varying
in size from 1 in. to 3 in., camel's-hair flowing brushes, <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>
to <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> in. in size, for applying color-and-varnish of some
kinds, chiseled badger hair brushes, double thick, 1 in. to 2
in. for varnishing gears, oval chiseled sash tools for cleaning up surfaces
and painting when needed certain parts of a vehicle, chiseled fitch tools for
cleaning up panels, and lastly not less than four sets of varnish brushes for
varnishing vehicle body surfaces, along with some oval or round chiseled
varnish brushes required especially in wagon painting.</p>

<p>The painter needs a set of at least three brushes, 1 in., <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> in., and <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>
in. in size, for varnishing the inside surfaces of bodies, these to be used for
no other purpose. Then, properly, he should have a set of brushes for
putting on first rubbing varnish coats, consisting of a 1-inch chiseled badger
hair brush, and a <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> in. and one 3-in. bristle brush. Then another set of
the same number for the remaining rubbing coats.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Long-Handled Spoke Brush.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The finishing kit of brushes may properly consist of five chiseled half
elastic flowing brushes, as follows: One 1-in., one <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>-inch, one 2-in., one
<span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>-in., one 3-in. Some finishers prefer a 1-in. badger hair brush for
flowing the edges of the panels, but the set of flowing brushes herewith
illustrated answers every purpose fully and completely. The art of fine
brush making has so far advanced within recent years that it is now possible
to get varnish brushes which require but very little working in varnish to
prepare them for flowing
on the finishing coats.</p>

<p>To clean a new varnish
brush preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to using it as a finishing brush, first draw the stock of the
tool through the fingers, continuing this operation until the
loose dirt is quite fully worked out. Then
repeatedly submerge it in clean linseed oil
and wipe out over the edge of a cup, after
which use it for a week or two in rubbing
varnish. The brush may then safely be used
for applying finishing coats of varnish.</p>

<p>In the matter of camel's-hair, badger hair,
and flowing varnish brushes, the painter desires
said brushes to be tough, durable fibre,
having soft ends, elastic, and which wear soft
until worn out.</p>

<p>In selecting the brush equipment, it is a most happy
mental exercise to remember that the highest type of brush,
if not mightier than the sword, at least hath its victories.</p>

<p>The numerous accompanying excellent illustrations of
brushes specially adapted to the needs of the carriage and
wagon painter are the result of valuable and courteously extended assistance
tendered by that celebrated brush making firm, John L. Whiting and Son
Co., Boston, Mass.</p>

APPLYING AND RUBBING IT&mdash;MATERIALS
USED IN FOUNDATION COATS&mdash;MIXING FORMULAS, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Fine and durable carriage and wagon painting cannot be accomplished
upon foundations in anywise weak or unstable. The supreme aim
of the painter, then, should be to begin at the base of the foundation
and, with patient toil and skill, aided by materials of recognized value,
bring up a surface of uniform excellence and quality.</p>


<h3>MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>White lead and raw linseed oil; an invincible combination in the old
days&mdash;shall we not say invincible still? Assuredly, nothing surpasses it
today when conditions are favorable to its proper treatment; nothing upon
the horizon of coming events bids fair to surpass it. It is only when the
limitations of time intervene, when we must perforce bow down and worship
the great American idol, Hurry, that the sinewy strength and permanency
of white lead, linseed oil, and the few other constituents which enter into
the foundation coats, are seriously shattered.</p>

<p>White lead, for example, must of necessity figure as an elemental part
of the lead coats, if not of the priming, of putty, and of roughstuff. It is
not now impossible to find primers being used entirely devoid of lead, but
the burden of proof remains favorable to the excellence of lead. A pigment
filler is quite as necessary as a liquid one. And pure white lead, Dutch
process, if it please my readers&mdash;observe its properties in this respect: It is
of great density, body, permanent to a rare degree, of impalpable smoothness
when properly ground, and chemically unites with oil, forming a kind
of varnish, which makes it a filler and pore sealer of great value. In
addition, it absorbs more oil, solidifies it, and remains elastic for a greater
length of time, except red lead perhaps, than any other pigment so far
discovered. Moreover, it mixes happily with all other pigments which do
not contain a sulphur ingredient. Briefly, these are the properties which
recommend it to the carriage painter. Its noble running mate, raw linseed
oil&mdash;what of it as a paint oil? Its chief virtue lies in the fact that when
exposed to the air it gradually, in drying, absorbs a large proportion of
oxygen, which, it is declared by Hurst, "forms a new compound of a
resinous character," remarkably elastic and stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the failure of the P. W. F.'s and various other substitutes for the
historic lead and oil surfacing agents, to meet the exacting needs of the
trade, the swift processes now practiced have pressed into service time
quickening aids which, in a work of this kind, it would scarcely seem fit to
omit.</p>

<p>Many painters have adopted yellow ochre as a main ingredient for
priming, and in particularly hurried instances, or, in fact, in the priming of
a certain grade of regular factory work, varnish and, to some extent,
turpentine are used. Ochre of good quality, finely ground (a coarse ground
ochre is worthless in carriage painting), and containing a strong percentage
of silica, is a valuable component of priming. Silica is an acknowledged
pore filler, and in many of the wood fillers heralded along the highway of
commerce it is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piece de resistance</i>. A high grade ochre is a good drying
and a very permanent pigment. It is a first-class surfacing material and not
easily affected by atmospheric or other impurities. Thus we have the
ingredients which, properly combined and manipulated, form the basis of all
beautiful and durable carriage painting as gauged according to present day
standards. Let us now consider the separate parts of the foundation
building.</p>


<h3>PRIMING.</h3>

<p>Priming is the agent required to go into and saturate the minute cells
and pores of the wood, getting a firm grip of the fibers, sealing them
against moisture, and affording the painter a tough, elastic ground for his
leveling materials to follow.</p>

<p>Primer No. 1.&mdash;White lead and raw linseed oil, darkened to a lead color
with lampblack. A teaspoonful of coach japan to be added to each pint of
the mixture, or omitted, as the time limit may impose.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;White lead, 2 parts; yellow ochre, 1 part. Liquid, raw linseed
oil. The use of japan to depend upon circumstances.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;White lead, 1 part; yellow ochre, 2 parts. Liquid, raw linseed oil.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;White lead, 1 part; yellow ochre, 2 parts. Liquids, rubbing
varnish <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; turpentine <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; raw linseed oil <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>. A tablespoonful of japan to
each quart of the mixture. This is a very quick primer, that can be sandpapered
the day following its application.</p>

<p>No. 5.&mdash;White lead, shaded with lampblack. Liquids, rubbing varnish
1 part; raw linseed oil 5 parts.</p>

<p>In the above formulas keg lead is referred to.</p>

<p>Priming should contain just enough pigment to stain the oil. Only in
this form does it perform the functions of a primer. Some hardwood
surfaces, negative in composition, require a priming thinned somewhat with
turpentine; otherwise such close textured spaces of wood are not sufficiently
penetrated by the oily particles of the priming. The durability of the
priming rests largely upon the penetration of the oil into the arteries of the
wood along with a certain necessary per cent. of the pigment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a good plan not to follow the surfacing of a job in the wood shop
too closely with the priming. Immoderate pressure of the wood fibres
usually results from the pressure of the wood worker's leveling methods.
Give the wood time to expand before priming, but not time to absorb
moisture. Graining out of surfaces often results from priming a surface too
soon as well as too late. Many factors must necessarily be considered in
order to have the priming coat do all that it should do. The condition of
the wood, the climate, season, atmosphere, etc., all require diligent study.
The application of the priming to the surface deserves particular attention.
Granted that first-class filling and surfacing pigments, combined with liquids
rich in gummy resinous matters, make the ideal primer, the coating fails of
its mission when practices of neglect mark its application to the surface.
Therefore, apply the priming smoothly and
in a uniform film to the surface. Coat all
parts of a job, outside, top, bottom&mdash;everywhere.
Insist upon its being well brushed
out&mdash;just as any coat of paint should be.</p>

</div>


<h3>THE LEAD COATS.</h3>

<p>What we shall be pleased to term "first
lead" was formerly made of white (keg) lead
thinned to a brushing consistency with linseed
oil and turpentine, half and half. That
was at a time when egg-shell gloss coats
were in demand. A different principle has
been established of late years in reference to
the composition of the lead coats, and the
egg-shell gloss is now regarded with suspicion
and, to a large extent, abandoned
altogether.</p>

<p>Consequently, the first lead should be
mixed of <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> oil to <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> turps, or even with a
still smaller percentage of oil if the limitations of time so direct. Apply
this lead with a bristle brush and enforce rigidly the rule of smoothness and
sleek brushing out.</p>

<p>"Second lead" means in modern paint shop lingo "flat lead"&mdash;a lead
that dries to a dull, lustreless appearance, practically "dead lead." It is
composed of white lead, thinned to a working consistency with turpentine,
and given a binder of oil to the extent of, say <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> of a tablespoonful of oil to
a pint of the lead. These lead coats should properly contain 1 teaspoonful
of japan to a pint of the lead, and be shaded with lampblack. The flat, or
dead, lead is best applied with a camel's-hair brush.</p>


<h3>RUB LEAD.</h3>

<p>In connection with these lead coats attention must be directed to the
rub lead process as a part of the system of lead surfacing now practiced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the leading shops of the country. The rub lead is usually used directly
upon the priming coat. There are several formulas in circulation for the
mixing of the lead, but the writer thinks the one here given (used in the
leading factory paint shops) covers the painter's practical needs fully. Mix
dry white lead to a grinding consistency in <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> raw linseed oil to <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> japan,
the liquids to be carefully measured. Add enough lampblack to give the
mixture a clean slate color, then run through the paint mill, after which
reduce to a brushing consistency with the proper proportions of oil and
japan. Make the lead just stiff enough to brush on with a fairly stiff bristle
brush. Apply to the surface and, after permitting the mixture to take on a
"tack" for a quarter of an hour or more as the drying conditions of the
apartment may be favorable or otherwise, proceed to rub the lead into the
surface with the palm of the hand. For getting a fine, velvety, and very
dense surface of pigment, the rub lead system has no rival. However, it
cannot be worked over and re-coated so soon after being applied (it should
be given 48 hours in which to dry) as can the knifing lead. This</p>


<h3>KNIFING LEAD,</h3>

<p>or "glazing lead," or "draw putty," as it is variously and locally known,
renders it possible to quickly fill and level up a surface, making it compact
and solid as to texture.</p>

<p>Knifing lead, No. 1.&mdash;Dry white lead <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; keg lead <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>. Liquids, rubbing
varnish and japan, thinning to the exact working consistency with a
little turps.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Dry white lead, mixed in equal parts of rubbing varnish and
japan.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Dry white lead <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>; keg lead <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; roughstuff filler (finely ground)
<span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>. Liquids, rubbing varnish <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>; japan <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; turpentine <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>. This last for
large panels.</p>

<p>These leads should all be colored slightly in the direction of the final
color to be used upon the work. Carriage and wagon painters use knifing
lead on running parts very largely, and especially upon work that must be
gotten out quicker than the rub lead would permit. On the panels of
business wagons of the medium grade, knifing lead is used to the exclusion
of roughstuff. On such panels it is advisable to apply the lead with a
bristle brush, applying the lead to the surface a little heavier in body than
ordinary paint, and then shortly going over it with a broad blade putty
knife, pressing the pigment into the wood and removing the surplus.</p>

<p>Knifing lead deserves to be used and applied with circumspect care and
skill if the best and most durable results would be achieved. It demands a
firm pressing into the cellular fabric of the wood, accompanied by a clean,
tidy removal of all the pigment not actually necessary to the full and
complete development of the surface. But little sandpapering should be
needed to fit it for any of the succeeding coats of material.</p>

<p>In the painting of running parts of the best grade, when rub lead or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
knifing lead is employed, the second lead, previously designated as "flat" or
"dead" lead, should be employed over the rub or knifing lead, the puttying
of the deep cavities and indentations being done directly upon said rub or
knifing leads.</p>


<h3>PUTTY&mdash;MAKING AND USING IT.</h3>

<p>Putty No. 1.&mdash;The putty of history&mdash;past, present, and shall we say of
the future?&mdash;so far
as history applies
to carriage painting,
is this putty
No. 1. Dry white
lead, japan and rubbing varnish, the liquids of equal proportions. Probably
the best known putty in the jobbing carriage paint shop today.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Spatula.</span></div>
</div>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Dry white lead <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; keg lead <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>. Rubbing varnish and japan,
half and half.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Keg lead, 4 parts; dry white lead 1 part. Rubbing varnish
and gold size japan, equal parts.</p>

<p>No. 4, a putty for white work.&mdash;Dry white lead <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>; pulverized steatite
or soapstone <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; dry oxide of zinc <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>; dry silica <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>. Liquids, very pale
rubbing varnish <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>; light (in color) japan <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>; turpentine <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>.</p>

<p>No. 5.&mdash;Dry white lead <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; keg lead <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>. Rubbing varnish and japan,
equal proportions. Into this mix the woof or fine pickings of velvet or
plush. This is especially intended to be used around glass in heavy vehicles.</p>

<p>No. 6.&mdash;This is a putty to be used on old work having rough cavities,
splintery crevices, and the like. It cannot be sandpapered, but will dry
tough, neither chipping nor flaking. Keg lead 1 part; whiting 2 parts.
Mix stiff in thick varnish and raw linseed oil, equal parts; then thicken up
to the right consistence with dry white lead.</p>

<p>No. 7.&mdash;For shallow cavities requiring a filling that dries quick and
hard. Dry lead 3 parts; plaster of paris 1 part. Equal parts of quick
rubbing varnish and japan.</p>

<p>No. 8.&mdash;Deep hole putty. Whiting mixed with raw linseed oil and
japan, equal parts. Then into this mixture mix plush woof. Drive a small
head tack or two
in bottom of hole
and then fill in
nearly level with
the surface with
this putty. Slash
a couple of openings into it with putty knife to quicken the drying, and
then in due time level up with regular putty.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Square Point Putty Knife.</span></div>
</div>

<p>No. 9.&mdash;Expansive shallow dents in a carriage surface require a peculiar
kind of putty or cement. Finely ground pumice stone 3 parts; dry lead 1
part. Mix to a working condition in thick glue. Apply the putty so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it will show some above the surface. After 10 hours rub down with lump
pumice stone and raw linseed oil.</p>

<p>No. 10.&mdash;Here is a putty that will stick and at the same time sandpaper
nicely. Shade dry lead with a little lampblack, and mix with <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> coach
japan and <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> rubbing varnish, along with a dash of turpentine.</p>

<p>The carriage painter will do well to use sparingly of whiting&mdash;even
gilder's whiting&mdash;in making a putty intended for use upon fine surfaces.
Whiting, or, in the speech of the chemist, carbonate of calcium, is a hard
drying, tenacious, stout sticking pigment, but possesses the ever present
property of granulating and working coarse and gritty under the putty
knife.</p>

<p>When coloring matter is added to putty, be governed by what the final
color of the job is to be. Hammer putty well on the mixing block to make
it tough and elastic. Do this at the time of making it and before use in
order to expel the accumulated moisture. Make it in sufficient quantity to
last for some time. Keep the putty in water in a dust proof holder&mdash;an air
tight one is better. See putty-holder illustrated herewith.</p>

<p>The way in which putty is applied has largely to do with making it
serve the surface good or ill. Good puttying is not accomplished by nimble
feats of jugglery. The putty knife demands to be skillfully handled and
wisely directed. Putty, in the economy of carriage painting, is quite as
indispensable as paint or varnish. In point of fact, each is dependent upon
the other. Just enough is a critical point in deciding how much and how
little of putty a surface requires. Here are four rules for guidance in the
art of puttying:</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Never putty on the priming coat.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Putty all work as smooth as possible. It is economy and increases
the chance for producing first-class work.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Avoid, <em>always</em>, puttying a crevice, depression, or cavity in the wood,
or a joint between two pieces of wood, that is subject to diverse forms of
resistance. The wrenching and twisting of the vehicle will loosen the
putty and eventually eject it.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;In puttying over nails, plugs, etc., press the pigment firmly into the
hole, filling just level with the surface, and carefully slick up all surplus
putty.</p>

<p>The painter will need for general puttying purposes, in addition to a
spatula or two (which see), at least four different styles of putty knife; one
large or wide blade knife, a two-inch blade say, one square point blade,
ordinary size, one beveled point, and one oval point. Knives of different
shapes will greatly facilitate the labor of puttying, which at best is often
tedious.</p>


<h3>SANDPAPERING</h3>

<p>If it were feasible, sandpaper would, no doubt, be voted down and out
of the paint shop. At present, however, it cannot well be removed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
system of carriage surfacing. The task of sandpapering, viewed from its
rosiest side, is toilsome, dirt-inviting, girt up by a waistband of unpleasant
features, but, alas! we must have level and smooth surfaces if we would
have beautiful ones, and sandpapering affords the means of getting them.
It is one of the aids&mdash;one of the great aids, let us bear in mind&mdash;to the
admirable surface
effects sought for
in the art of carriage
painting. It
cannot be slighted
or to any extent
be done imperfectly without marring the appearance or subtracting from the
durability of the surface when finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_b_023a.jpg" width="450" height="78" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Beveled Point Putty Knife.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The use of sandpaper begins before even the priming coat has taken its
position. A surface well sandpapered ahead of the priming coat saves a
great deal of time and leaves plenty of the priming film on the surface
where it is needed. No. 1 paper is the proper size to surface the priming
coat, if the surface has previously been well smoothed. The No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> will do
for first lead. This coat requires a very thorough and uniform going over,
touching completely all places that need it, touching none with a coarse
hand, and never laying bare a flicker of wood needing a full depth of
protecting pigment. The second lead, or "dead lead" as we know it, should
require only a light going over with No. 0 paper, this to be followed by
polishing with curled hair or fine moss used by trimmers.</p>

<p>The rub lead and knifing lead coats usually respond to the smoothing
caress of No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>, or finer, paper, the size depending upon the quality of
these coats. All along through the system of painting, sandpaper must
needs sound its smoothing monotone, but particularly upon the primary
coats does the painter use it as the fulcrum by which, among other aids, he
seeks to rear his paint foundation into a tower of strength.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_b_023b.jpg" width="450" height="82" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Oval Point Putty Knife.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Mouldings, clips, bolt heads, difficult places to work up to, everywhere
bespeak the same thorough touch of the sandpaper. There are many sharp
edges about a vehicle which may be denuded of pigment at a single rasp of
the paper. Such
parts require a
good measure of
protection, otherwise
flaking and
chipping of the
paint and varnish must naturally follow. The painter may well strive to
make the work of sandpapering an exact operation&mdash;exact as to thoroughness
as applied to all parts of a surface, and exact as to a uniformity of results.</p>

<p>In company with the labor of sandpapering must be considered dusting.
The latter should be cleanly and tidily done, quite as thorough, indeed, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the sandpapering or any other of the operations, all alike important. We
now come to an article indispensable to the painter in arriving at a state of
perfection regarding smoothness of surface.</p>


<h3>ROUGHSTUFF&mdash;HOW MADE, APPLIED, AND RUBBED.</h3>

<p>Webster defines "rough" as "having inequalities, small ridges, or points
on the surface," and "stuff" as "refuse or worthless matter." But, combining
the two words into one&mdash;roughstuff&mdash;the painter construes the term
to mean something different from the construction put upon it by the eminent
lexicographer when he cleaved it evenly in twain.</p>

<p>Without the coarse mineral pigments known as "fillers," white lead,
and the liquid mediums used to properly unite and weld them together and
denominated roughstuff when ready for use, the painter, in his effort to
make satisfactorily level and smooth surfaces, would be in almost as sorry a
plight as the mariner bereft of his compass. For, mark you, gentle <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</i>!
roughstuff <em>is</em> essential to carriage body surface elegancies and mirror-like
effects.</p>


<h3>FAVORITE FORMULAS.</h3>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;To 3 lbs. of any American filler add 1 lb. keg white lead. Beat
well together; then reduce to a thick paste with rubbing varnish and japan,
after which thin to brushing consistency with turps. This is a safe one-coat-per-day
'stuff.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Equal parts of filler (excepting English) and keg lead, by
weight, reduced to a heavy paste in quick rubbing varnish and japan, and
then cut with turps to the proper consistency. Two coats per day may be
safely applied.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Five lbs. filler (still excepting English); <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> lbs. keg lead; <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>
elastic rubbing varnish; <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> japan. This is a 'stuff for fine, heavy coach
work. Apply coat every 72 hours. Do not rub out under three weeks.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;(A London formula.) Dry white lead, ground stiff in turpentine,
<span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> lbs.; ochre, or English filling, ground stiff in turpentine, 4 lbs. Mix
the two and add <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> lb. of tub lead. Add 1 pint of japan gold size and
about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> pint of the bottoms of wearing varnish. Reduce with a little
turpentine if necessary. This is a very durable and elastic 'stuff.</p>

<p>No. 5.&mdash;(M. Arlot's formula.) "Grind separately lump white lead with
essence of turpentine, and do the same with unwashed yellow ochre; then
mix the two pastes in the proportion of <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> of white lead and <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> of ochre.
Allow the mixture to stand exposed to the air or to a gentle heat in order to
evaporate the excess of liquid, and add gradually small portions of good
drying oil, taking care to stir and beat the mixture well with a brush, as in
distemper painting. The paste thus acquires more body." Concerning this
'stuff the author adds: "It is possible with this composition to give three coats
in a day's work, but after the last coat we must wait 48 hours for drying."</p>

<p>No. 6.&mdash;English filler 3 lbs.; keg lead 1 lb. Rubbing varnish and
japan, half and half, to make a stiff paste. Thin with turpentine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 7.&mdash;English filler, mixed stiff with rubbing varnish, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>; japan <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>.
Thinned with turpentine.</p>

<p>Probably genuine English filler has but few, if any, equals, and
certainly no superiors as a roughstuff pigment. It polishes down very close
and compact as to texture, giving a glass-like, non-porous surface. It
requires less lead than other fillers, because of which property it was
specially mentioned as excluded from formulas 2 and 3. It does not
surface down as easily as some of the American fillers, a fact that has
probably limited its use largely.</p>

<p>In using keg lead for roughstuff, a moderately stiff ground lead is advisable.
A lead ground in an excess of oil will necessitate washing in turps to
expel a portion of the oil, if the proper proportions of ingredients would be
maintained. In mixing roughstuff, it pays to be exact as to proportions and
quantities. Use first-class materials, varnish, japan, etc. Slops and refuse
from varnish and japan cans are to be avoided. They leave the user in a
state of uncertainty as to the composition of his 'stuff. If made in considerable
quantities at a time, the pigment should be stored in a tight, dust-free
receptacle and well covered with
water or turps, else it will very
soon become gummy and unsuitable
for good work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_025.jpg" width="300" height="168" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Paint Strainer.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The chief mission of roughstuff
is to enable the painter to get a
firm, hard, level surface. It requires
putting on with a good
brush, and a skilled and painstaking
wielder of the tool. Roughstuff
should be carried to a surface a little heavier in body than ordinary
paint, but its spreading and flatting property should in no wise be made
sluggish and "ropy" by the absence of thinning mediums. Better an
additional coat of 'stuff than one coat less because of the excessively thick
coats used. Roughstuff, like all quick setting pigments, needs to be applied,
brushed out, and leveled quickly under the brush, so that brush marks may
not intrude or uniformity in depth of film be wanting. Use a brush suited
to the size of the panel; likewise a brush with a softness and fineness of
point and sufficient elasticity to insure, if properly wielded, freedom from
brush marks. Too heavy a pigment is no more a prolific cause of brush
marks than a too nearly worn out brush. If the first coat of 'stuff is laid
on the panel with horizontal strokes of the brush, let the second be laid with
vertical ones, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. On a well-surfaced job, four coats should
suffice. Where greater inequalities of the surface exist, more coats will be
necessary. But it is an established maxim in both the practice and theory
of carriage painting that the less roughstuff used upon a surface, granted
that the quantity accords perfectly with the needs of the surface, the greater
the durability of the paint and varnish structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The successful user of roughstuff is one who duly considers the
importance of having a correctly-proportioned, finely-balanced mixture
skillfully applied to the surface amid surroundings favorable to its prompt
and thorough drying.</p>

<p>A guide coat to be used over roughstuff is made of a little of the 'stuff
colored a bit with yellow ochre or Venetian red and thinned down considerably
thinner than the 'stuff, with turpentine.</p>

<p>The workman who has roughstuff to rub requires, as an outfit, plenty
of clean water right at hand, a good sponge, chamois skin, and a varied
assortment of rubbing stones and bricks. The rubbing brick product, of
German origin, has been considerably improved of late years; to such an
extent, in fact, that it is now possible to obtain it as fine as wished for, and
running from that up to a very coarse quality. However, for the very high
class work, the natural lava, or pumice stone, is not to be surpassed. The
quality of the rubbing accomplished depends much upon the selection of the
blocks of pumice stone. The blocks of light weight, open grain, tunneled
with innumerable air cells, are to be preferred for good cutting properties.
Immersed in water, they float instead of sinking. The buoyancy of a piece
of lava determines its porosity and its cutting power. This kind of stone
may be used until the surface is well reduced, when, preferably, the stone of
closer texture and tighter grain may next be used and continued in use until
the final dressing up has been concluded. Select stones of large cutting
surface. After the sawing, filing, and necessary dressing up of the stone in
preparing it for the surface, it merits a thorough washing and rinsing to
cleanse it from all minute atoms of grit, etc. In the actual work of rubbing
a surface, keep the surface well washed to prevent gumming of the stone
and to enable the eye to see just what the mind and muscle are doing; but
do not flood the work with water. The rubbing stone is doing its work
properly when, under an even, gentle pressure, it cuts smooth and free with
a clinging, adhesive motion. When a particle of grit becomes lodged under
the stone there will be a rolling, jarring motion, easy for even an unpracticed
hand to detect, provided vigilant attention is being directed upon the work.
When scratching of the surface occurs, the rubbing stone requires smoothing
off with another stone, and the surface, stone, etc., given a thorough
rinsing with clean water. Circular, zig-zagging motions of the stone are
ill-advised. Straight, clean strokes, all directed in one general direction,
are best and most effective. A surface is not always rubbed sufficiently fine
when the guide coat disappears. The guide coat may be but a mere wash
and disappear almost completely under a few strokes of the stone. The
disappearance of such a guide(?) coat is not evidence that the proper surface
has been reached. By repeatedly drawing the hand, with a good pressure,
across the surface at right angles with the direction that governed the
laying off of the final coat of filler, the workman can very accurately decide
when an adequately fine surface has been reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>To determine when a surface has been rubbed just enough usually gives
the inexperienced rubber no little difficulty, but with practice he will master
the accomplishment. On moulded panels it is advisable to rub the edges of
the surface first, as it will lessen the tendency to thrust the stone forcibly
against the moulding, thus chipping off atoms of stone to be ground into the
surface later on.</p>

<p>Rubbing the roughstuff is the final process in the art of developing the
comely and durable foundation. Does not the work, then, merit a full
measure of skill, alertness, and patience in its execution?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">PRISMATIC AND OBJECTIVE COLOR&mdash;HARMONIZING AND CONTRASTING
COLORS&mdash;MIXING COLORS&mdash;TESTING THEM&mdash;ASSAYING FOR OPACITY,
COLORING STRENGTH, BRILLIANCY, ETC.&mdash;TABLE FOR COMPOUNDING
COACH COLORS, HUES, AND TINTS.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">While colors, as we know them, differ from each other, they exist,
according to the generally accepted theory, as simply different
movements of the same element. The immense ocean of ether,
which is in all space, is one, and the colors are all waves of that one ocean.</p>

<p>When a ray of light undergoes a change of direction it is divided into
many minor rays, which to our visual sense are represented as colors. As,
for example, if a ray of white light be directed through the edge of a
triangular prism so that its course is bent or refracted, the ray is divided into
several different rays of colors, these being thereby termed spectrum colors.</p>

<p>It is practically agreed by authorities that the rainbow affords the most
complete illustration of spectrum colors, these being formed by the passage
of light through the spray or drops of water in a shower. Color, then, may
be said to be due to the action of light. Hence the established dictum,
namely, white is a reunion of all the colored rays of the prismatic spectrum.
It is a basic element in every color except black, and, as a color, black
figures as an absolute neutral, it being devoid of white light.</p>

<p>The conditions and circumstances which unite to produce the varying
and various color sensations have never yet been unanimously agreed upon
by the eminent color theorists. The practical man may thread the remotest
confines of color theories as expounded by Newton, Brewster Jones, Field,
Rood, Young, and others, until his adventures bring him out on the toil-won
heights and stupendous summits of the modern science of colors, and
what he beholds will simply tend to confuse his intellect and more than ever
convince him that the mastery of color laws remains yet to be accomplished;
that no unalterable rule can be successfully applied to the theory of color.
To those of my readers who desire to explore deeply into the recesses of
color science, I would recommend the works by the afore-mentioned colorists.
It is the purpose to deal in this chapter, so far as possible, with the more
practical aspects of the science.</p>

<p>Objective color, as distinguished from what is termed illusive or prismatic
color, is confined to those substances or materials endowed with the
selective property for absorbing the colored rays from the light which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
imparted to them, and which, in the technology of painting, are known as
pigments.</p>

<p>The colors which make up the three orders usually, but not invariably,
recognized by modern colorists, and which practically apply to the needs of
the vehicle painter, may be placed as follows:<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Carmine, ultramarine blue, and lemon chrome yellow most nearly
approach to the prismatic colors, and, taking them for the primaries, we
find, according to the deductions of Chevreul and others, that in proportional
strength they rank thus: Yellow, the weakest, 3; red, medium, 5;
blue, strongest, 8. To form the secondary colors, yellow, 3 parts, and blue,
8 parts, produces green, which is the contrasting color to red, the contrasting
primary being always the color not contained in the secondary. Purple, the
contrast to yellow, contains red, 5 parts; blue, 8 parts. Orange, the contrast
to blue, has red, 5 parts; yellow, 3 parts. Any color in the secondary
column opposite a color in the primary column is the contrasting color to
that primary, and in the tertiary column, the tertiary opposite any given
secondary may be accepted as the harmonizing color to that secondary's
contrasting primary; as, for example, yellow, the primary, has purple as its
contrasting, and citron as its harmonizing, color. In like manner russet
harmonizes with red and olive with blue. The tertiaries may be produced
by uniting the secondaries in equal proportions, or by the primaries being
combined in the proportion of 2 parts of any given primary and 1 part of
each of the two remaining primaries. For instance, olive is made of purple
and green, both secondaries, or it may be made of blue, 2 parts, and 1 part
each red and yellow. Citron is made from green and orange; russet from
orange and purple. Referring to the three different orders of colors, it will
be found that experiment will enable one to effect many changes in the
development of color harmony. Any one color of any of the three orders
will harmonize with the colors which contrast with the remaining two colors
of the same order. Take the primary, blue. The contrasting colors to the
remaining two primaries are purple and green, with which blue harmonizes.
The contrasts to the primaries, red and blue, are respectively green and
orange, with which the third primary, yellow, harmonizes. Or red will
harmonize with the contrasts to the primaries, yellow and blue, which are
purple and orange. Continuing the experiment to the secondary colors, it
is found that green harmonizes with citron and olive, the contrasts to the two
remaining secondaries, purple and orange; purple harmonizes with russet
(russet contains a double share of red, bear in mind) and olive, both being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
contrasts to orange and green, the other secondaries. Orange harmonizes
with citron and russet, the contrasts to purple and green.</p>

<p>These experiments in the domain of color contrasts and harmony might
be pursued indefinitely, but the above will suffice to afford the student who
essays the colorist's art (and what vehicle painter doesn't aspire to that art?)
a practical working plan for the acquirement of such information as will
enable him ultimately to successfully meet the exacting requirements of
modern vehicle ornamentation. Knowledge of the harmony of analogy, a
simple, effective, and ready way of varying painting, together with a
knowledge of contrasts, the finer, higher, and superior system of effecting
the most adorable and fetching color adornment, is an indispensable help to
the painter, to attain which he can well afford to make many sacrifices.</p>

<p>The harmony of color as it applies to the use of two or more colors
with reference to the relationships which should exist between them,
requires to be further intensified by a strict and vigilant regard for the
season, conditions, and circumstances which obtain when certain combinations
of colors are employed. And for this reason: Blue is a cold color,
chilly in the extreme at some seasons of the year, upon certain surfaces. It
may be called a space color and imparts a retiring effect to form. Red,
applied to form, appears stationary and gives a warmth of sentiment.
Orange is, if anything, warmer in its effect than a full red. Bright yellow
tends to excitement of the vision. Green has a conspicuous or advancing
appearance.</p>

<p>The primary colors have no established hues, tints, or shades, but in
every compound of the primaries a hue is recognizable. Green, for instance,
as a compound of blue and yellow, can be made to vary surprisingly in hue
as the proportion of one primary is increased and the other reduced, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>In every compound of the primaries the predominating primary fixes
the hue thereof. Hue, then, as an authority has well said, may be "a
mixture of two or more colors of any order, but the mixture should not
depart from the original color."</p>

<p>Tone, as applied to a color, measures the depth of the hue of that color.</p>

<p>Dilute a color, or the hue thereof, with white, and a tint of that color
or hue is the result. To illustrate: By adding white to chrome yellow, the
yellow is reduced along down through the long lists of tints until it reaches
white.</p>

<p>A color or hue deepened by the addition of black becomes a shade of
that color or hue; or, in other words, a shade is any color made deeper by
the addition of black. The positive colors contain no white or black by
mixture, while the negative colors do contain white or black or both.</p>


<h3>THE MIXING OF COLORS,</h3>

<p>in view of the fact that the manufacture of them has now reached a very
high state of perfection, would seem to be a comparatively easy matter, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
it must be understood that in vehicle painting, business vehicle painting
especially, there are many hues, tints, and shades demanded which the color
maker does not furnish. Such mixtures have to be prepared by the painter,
and the work becomes a skilled operation. First he must be fortified with
a clear knowledge of the proportions of the ingredients required to form the
desired color or hue thereof, or tint or shade. Then he must skillfully and
<em>perfectly</em> combine them. The word "perfectly" is emphasized because if the
constituents be not perfectly combined, a long train of evils is invited. A
most minute and perfect incorporation of all the particles of the paint
material must be made, otherwise a lack of uniformity in strength, coloring,
and covering power results. Certain colors have a property of unduly
asserting themselves when combined with certain other colors in the mixing
cup, and if allowance be not made for this assertive strength and a very
thorough mixture of the parts effected, the color, when applied to the
surface, is apt to show streaks. Some pigments require grinding upon the
slab under the muller to obtain an absolutely perfect commingling of the
particles.</p>

<p>This rule applies to the mixing of pigments: The more perfect the
mixing, the more perfect the product; perfect not only as regards its strength,
permanence, and brilliancy of color, but perfect also as regards its working
properties.</p>

<p>While two or more pigments may mix nicely together, they may not
liquify readily, and unless the workman be thorough in his mixing operations,
lack of a uniform film of color ensues, a condition which later on
develops the faded and bleached out surface, and in many instances the
flaking and shelly one. The painter who would become a skilled mixer of
pigment will insist upon exact quantitative measurements of all the ingredients
he may employ, both liquids and solids, when such measurements are
possible, and he will further see that the ingredients are perfectly united.</p>

<p>The attainment of a high average of results in the use of colors depends
greatly upon the achievements of the color maker and upon the uniform
quality of his product. Fineness of grinding, uniformity of color in respect
to its coloring and covering power, and brilliancy, are valued essentials. It
is necessary that the painter should get from the color maker not one, two,
or three successive lots of color that are of standard color, tint, or shade,
but <em>every</em> lot should correspond to the exact standard. When the painter
opens a new lot of color, he desires it to be exactly like the last in every
particular, provided, of course, the last lot was standard. Hence, uniformity
of color, of tint, of shade, of quality throughout, is a requirement with which
the color maker may properly be expected to comply. It will thus be
observed that the purchase of colors is one of the really important steps
leading up to fine and durable color effects.</p>

<p>In testing a color for covering power or opacity, for coloring strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and for brilliancy, comparison should always be made with a strictly standard
color.</p>

<p>To assay for covering power or opacity, weigh out, say 50 grains, of the
standard color and the same number of grains of the color under examination,
and to each sample add 10 grains of fine china clay, if the colors be
dark, or 10 grains of the highest grade of lampblack (this being a pure
black) should they be light, and mix intimately. The sample which departs
the least from its own color has the best body or covering power. Or mix
exactly equal quantities of the standard color and the color to be assayed, in
equal quantities of raw linseed oil, incorporating the oil and the pigment
thoroughly, and then apply to glass surfaces (small panes of window glass
answer the purpose fully), spreading the pigment as evenly as possible.
The sample covering the glass most solidly has the strongest covering power.</p>

<p>Coloring power is determined by mixing a given quantity of a standard
sample of color with a certain quantity of china clay or, if preferred, zinc
white. Of the sample to be assayed take the same quantity of color and
mix with exactly the same quantity of china clay or zinc white used with
the standard. The sample showing the greatest depth of color may be
accepted as having the strongest coloring power.</p>

<p>The durability or permanency of a pigment may be tested by mixing
the pigment with raw linseed oil, spreading on a piece of glass, exposing it
to the rigors of the weather, and noting its condition from time to time.</p>

<p>The fineness of a color or pigment can be judged by rubbing the
material between two thick pieces of glass or subjecting it to a powerful
microscopic examination. Or a common fruit can with a tight cover may
be two-thirds filled with clean water, half an ounce of color put therein,
and the contents vigorously shaken. The finer the sample is ground, the
longer the time it will require to settle out.</p>

<p>The following table is intended to aid in the compounding of the principal
hues, tints, and shades of colors used in carriage and wagon painting.
It would prove futile to try to make the proportions arbitrary, because the
uniformity of colors advocated above does not universally obtain, the
product of one firm differing from that of other firms and very often, unfortunately,
lacking uniformity in itself.</p>

<p>Moreover, color sense has not reached a uniform development, and the
proportions which would, for example, make a cherry red as accepted by
one person might not appear that color to the second person. However, in
most of the formulas proportions are indicated, and the table is presented not
as an infallible guide, but more in the nature of a reliably helpful one.</p>

<span class="chapterheader">THE APPLICATION OF COLORS TO SURFACES.&mdash;GREENS&mdash;BLUES&mdash;REDS&mdash;YELLOWS&mdash;BROWNS&mdash;BLACKS&mdash;WHITE.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The greens comprise a class of colors many of which are leaders in
popularity as panel colors on heavy pleasure vehicles, such as landaus,
broughams, rockaways, etc. Nearly all the greens are used
as solid colors, requiring no specially prepared ground work color. The
ease, however, with which solidity and density of color is obtained upon a
surface is greatly overshadowed by the difficulty&mdash;the extreme difficulty,
perhaps I should say&mdash;of applying most of the fine carriage greens now
fashionable. Such greens as olive, Quaker, Brewster, and Merrimac green,
individually and collectively favorites, require very deft and painstaking
manipulation in the cup and under the brush in order to insure workman-like
results. Probably olive green manifests the most pronounced disposition
to assert the strength of some one or more of its color constituents independently
and to the detriment of the remaining ones. To overcome this
difficulty, the color in the cup should be stirred frequently after having been
mixed thoroughly when in preparation for the surface. In applying greens
to the surface&mdash;and this statement is intended to cover the entire list of
greens used in carriage and wagon painting&mdash;cross brushing at the final
conclusion of laying off the color may well be avoided. The tendency of
cross brushing at the ends of a panel is to show two or more different shades
of the same green. The rule holds good, when using the greens, to adhere
to thorough methods of mixing, to keep the color well stirred in the cup,
and to desist from cross brushing at the extremities of the panels in
finishing up.</p>

<p>These characteristics so conspicuously developed as opportunity offers
have prompted a majority of carriage painters and colorists in our best shops
to use most of the greens employed on fine carriage surfaces in the capacity
of flat color coats (two coats in nearly all cases covering solid) and then
applying clear rubbing varnish, thus doing away with the color-and-varnish
coats altogether. The greens which are used as glazing colors comprise
ultramarine green, verdigris, and transparent bronze green.</p>


<h3>THE BLUES.</h3>

<p>Next to the greens in popularity as fine panel colors come the blues,
ultramarine blue ranking as the most widely used of the various varieties.
The elegance and aristocratic effects obtained by the employment of ultramarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
blue are secured only by the development of a ground work free from
imperfections. As a matter of fact, the successful use of almost every coach
color, whether used as a glazing color or otherwise, is contingent upon the
quality of the ground color and upon such a harmonious assimilation of the
different coats as will promote the greatest elasticity and permanence. Of
the ultramarine blue there are three shades, light, medium, and dark. Most
color manufacturers prepare and sell ground colors adapted to the different
shades of the blue, the ultramarine being invariably used as a color-and-varnish
or glazing coat. Nevertheless, it is often necessary, even if not
desirable, to shop prepare the ground color for the ultramarine blues when
wanted.</p>

<p>For the light shade of ultramarine blue, Prussian blue and a superior
grade of white lead are so combined as to produce a blue of good depth and
body, unusual care being taken to have the blue and white thoroughly
united and beaten into one indivisible pigment. If keg lead be used in
making the ground, the oil should be first completely washed out of the
pigment with benzine or turpentine, and varnish, instead of oil, be employed
as the color binder. This practice provides for sure and reliable drying of
the ground color. The ground for the medium ultramarine blue may be
made of the ingredients above stated, the color being simply adjusted to a
deeper shade of blue, more blue and less white being used in the admixture.
In both the light and the medium, the ground color should approximate the
glaze color and enhance the richness of effect. For the dark shade of ultramarine
blue, a coat of lampblack furnishes a most excellent and effective
ground color.</p>

<p>Probably the richest effect in blue is furnished by glazing ultramarine
blue over a ground of very deep green. Transparent cobalt blue, a glaze
color always, requires a ground of Prussian blue and white. Body cobalt is
used as a solid color, and for a panel color on traps, breaks, and vehicles of
that order it produces admirable and fetching effects. The glaze colors are
best used in a flowing medium of elastic rubbing varnish, especially when
body surfaces are being coated, and the brushes adapted to applying such
colors are the <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>-inch and the 2-inch badger flowing brush or a soft, half-elastic
bristle brush suited to the size of the panels being coated.</p>


<h3>REDS, WINES, AND OTHER COLORS OF THE RED ORDER.</h3>

<p>For warmth and brilliancy of color effects, carmine among a long list of
gorgeous reds, is without a rival. Carmine is a glaze color exclusively, and
the splendor of its radiance is governed entirely by the ground color.
Carmine, along with its near relatives of the red order, has a decided
tendency to fade, flake, and chip off. The ground color, therefore, must, in
addition to being faultless in color density and surface features, be possessed
of great enduring qualities. It may be accepted as a rule worthy of practice
that the ground colors for the general order of reds should be mixed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
binder of varnish sufficiently strong to impart to them when dry at least a
faint gloss&mdash;an egg-shell gloss, if it please my community of readers. A
ground so prepared is fortified to counteract the fading and flaking properties
of such of the reds as are used as glaze colors.</p>

<p>To secure a first-class job of light carmine, bring the surface up level
and smooth, and then apply a coat of peach-blow color, made of white and
some one of the ordinary reds. Over this apply a coat of deep English
vermilion, using the vermilion stoutly charged with rubbing varnish.
Polish this coat, when dry, with curled hair and apply a second coat of the
vermilion, adding a sufficiency of varnish to convert the mixture to the
color-and-varnish class. At the proper time this coat should, preferably, be
rubbed lightly with pumice stone and water. Next apply a coat of clear
rubbing varnish, which in due time also demands rubbing with pulverized
pumice stone and water. Then to rubbing varnish, elastic or quick, hard
drying, as the size of the surface may dictate, add enough of No. 40 carmine
to fully stain the liquid, say <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> of an ounce of carmine to one full pint of
varnish (many first-class painters use <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> oz. carmine to 1 pint of varnish),
and apply to the surface, be it body or gear, with a soft badger or bristle
brush. For a less expensive job, omit the coat of clear rubbing varnish
and apply the carmine directly to the vermilion.</p>

<p>A method easier to carry into execution in painting a carmine job
consists in adding a little carmine to the last coat of vermilion color-and-varnish.
This coat is rubbed with curled hair; then carmine is added to
varnish, as in the first method, after which a <em>small</em> quantity of vermilion is
put in to give the mixture opacity or covering power. Clouding and such
other incidental imperfections to be considered in connection with the work
of one not really an expert in the manipulation of glaze colors, is thereby
avoided. For a darker carmine, use a ground of flamingo red, carmine red
(a solid color), road-cart red, Kalliston red, or permanent scarlet, dark shade,
the latter color requiring a light vermilion ground.</p>

<p>In applying carmine to wheels, it is advisable to flow the whole wheel
at once, instead of doing them in sections, as by this practice a cleaner,
clearer, and more satisfactory job is secured. For the gear, do the whole of
one end of it before wiping up, then the final end, finishing with the reach
and side bars, if there be side bars. To obtain the real purple and fine linen
of carmine effects, the color-and-varnish requires to be flowed on freely and
quickly, and promptly slicked up. Pottering and sectional patching up
invites inferior results.</p>

<p>The vermilions, of which there is at present quite a formidable list,
ranging from the glaring light shades to the glowing dark ones, all bespeak
carefully prepared and durable grounds, if satisfactory wearing and appearing
qualities are to be attained. Vermilions may properly, it would seem, be
classed among the fugitive colors, and their retention of purity of color is
therefore dependent upon the grounds employed to support them. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
previously stated, a peach-blow color forms a good ground for vermilion. It
should be made to dry with an egg-shell gloss so as to overcome the fading
propensity of the vermilion. Then let the first coat of vermilion have a
decided gloss. The final coat of vermilion is placed as color-and-varnish.
Linseed oil should not be used in vermilion, as it darkens the color and
destroys its brilliancy. Ditto japan.</p>

<p>The large class of modern reds known under such alluring titles as
C. P. red, flamingo red, brilliant coach red, Ottoman red, Kalliston red, etc.,
are usually applied over ground colors specially supplied by the manufacturer.
With but few exceptions, such reds are used in this way: One coat
of color, one coat of color-and-varnish, "dead," or lustreless, coats being
carefully avoided.</p>

<p>Indian red in at least two distinct shades, pale and deep, and Tuscan
red in three shades are largely used for running parts and panel colors on
certain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin de siecle</i> pleasure vehicles, and they are painted as solid colors,
one coat flat color and one coat color-and-varnish.</p>

<p>In wagon painting, wine colors in half a dozen shades are used. They
also need the supporting strength of very stable grounds. Indian red and
Tuscan red, of shades suited to the shades of the wine color afford excellent
ground colors. If ample time be at the command of the painter, mix these
grounds with a binder of raw linseed oil. For hurried work, use a binder
of varnish.</p>

<p>Among carriage painters generally, the lakes have never been classed as
strictly permanent pigments. At the same time, in the creed of modern
carriage and wagon painting they are indispensable. Of those probably the
best known in the vehicle paint shop, may be mentioned maroon lake,
Munich, carriage part, permanent scarlet, scarlet, red, English rose lake,
purple lake, carmine lake, and crimson lake.</p>

<p>Maroon lake is best glazed over a deep Tuscan red ground; Munich
lake over extra deep Tuscan red or lampblack; carriage part lake over the
same ground as Munich; permanent scarlet over vermilion; scarlet lake over
light vermilion; red lake over pale Tuscan red; English rose lake over extra
deep Tuscan red; purple lake over a ground made of Tuscan red and
Prussian blue. Carmine lake furnishes many of the gleaming and beautiful
effects of No. 40 carmine when used over such grounds as are best adapted
to genuine carmine. Crimson lake is used over vermilion grounds and
furnishes a color of great warmth and richness.</p>

<p>It is advisable, when perfecting the ground for the lakes, to add to the
last coat of ground color some of the lake to be used over it, as a mellowing,
toning ingredient. The non-elastic quality of the lakes suggests the use of
elastic rubbing varnish when preparing the lake color-and-varnish. This
will impart elasticity and adhesiveness.</p>


<h3>THE YELLOWS.</h3>

<p>Among the yellows are many delicate shades which require strong basic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
color coats to support them properly. In the painting of a yellow surface,
be it of the most delicate or the most powerful shade of yellow, the initial
coats of color may very correctly be white. Have the surface smooth and
clean, and if it be the running parts of the vehicle, and the priming coat is
already on, mix the keg lead in, say one-half raw linseed oil and one-half
turpentine, using a teaspoonful of coach japan to each pint of the paint.
Apply this coat with an oval bristle brush. When dry, sand off lightly
with No. 1 paper, putty with white putty wherever necessary, doing the
work so smoothly as to require no sanding, and then with a camel's-hair
brush apply a second coat of the white containing a strong binder of oil and
thinned to a free working consistency with "turps." Over this ground most
of the yellows can be brought to the proper depth and density of color with
two coats of color and one coat of color-and-varnish. This for the running
parts. Upon body surfaces having a roughstuff base, wash the keg white
lead free of oil with benzine or turps, adding a binder of rubbing varnish,
and apply two coats of the white with a two-inch camel's-hair brush,
polishing each coat with clean curled hair. Then apply the yellow, using
the final coat in the capacity of color-and-varnish. There is economy of
time, labor, and pigment in using a white ground for yellow. Moreover,
the natural bleaching propensity of the yellows is distinctly checked through
the agency of a white ground. All colors in light shades evince a natural
tendency to darken as they fade and lose their original purity of tone. The
white ground operates to overcome this tendency, to arrest this deepening
process, to hold the yellow to its true color; and it does this by reason of the
fact that it offers the yellow a white base instead of a positive, assertive one,
to strike through. In other words, the yellow, as it responds to the process
of drying, is influenced by the lighter color beneath, the one counteracting
the other.</p>

<p>That renowned French authority on coach painting, M. Arlot, is upon
record as advising primary coats of white lead as a base for yellows. The
writer has personal knowledge of the value of white basic coats for the
numerous family of colors in question, and therefore strongly advises their
employment. Primrose, canary, and sulphur yellow are among the most
fashionable of the pale yellows and require careful working out under the
brush. With the yellows must be considered yellow lake. This is used
only as a glaze color. Put over the solid greens, it gives to them depth and
richness. Placed over Brewster green, for example, it renders a particularly
elegant effect. Put over many of the brilliant reds, it imparts a fine and
exquisite effect.</p>


<h3>THE BROWNS.</h3>

<p>In business vehicle painting, the browns receive consideration. Vandyke
brown, a warm brown color inclining to a reddish hue, can be used for
one coat of color and one coat of color-and-varnish. If desired, a first, or
ground, color can be made of drop black, yellow, and red. A close imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of this famous brown can, in fact, be made of the three colors just named.</p>

<p>Vienna brown, a justly and widely esteemed color for vehicle bodies, is
a warm, rich brown and requires a ground color of deep, Indian red. Over
this ground apply one coat of color and one of color-and-varnish. This
brown is obtainable in two shades, light and deep. London smoke, a much
used running part color, is painted solid color&mdash;one coat color, one coat
color-and-varnish. Burnt Italian sienna and burnt Turkey umber are likewise
painted solid colors. As a whole, the browns, as colors, are easily
applied to the surface and may be classed as good wearing colors.</p>


<h3>BLACKS.</h3>

<p>In carriage painting, the black surface fairly reigns supreme. At first
thought, the painting of a fine black surface would seem to involve a very
common turn of trade craft. It involves, in the largest sense, a high grade
of workmanship, rather than a common one, this painting of the black
surface. Coach black ground in japan, in which state the carriage painter
gets it, should have a binder of varnish, instead of oil, and should be
thinned with turps so as to spread freely under a camel's-hair brush and to
flat out to a fine, soft, velvety texture. Easy working, without brush
marks, is a paramount virtue, regardless of the opacity or covering power of
the black. A high grade ivory black is less opaque, and consequently
covers less solidly, coat for coat, than does the cheaper, but less lustrous,
black. Hence, the covering power of a color can never be accepted as a
safe guide to direct the thinning of said color. To make the highest quality
of black to cover as solidly at one coat as an inferior grade of black at one
coat might, would necessitate using the best black so thick as to invite a
disastrous sweep of brush marks. More and thinner coats of color, minus
brush marks, are preferable to fewer and heavier coats with brush marks in
plenty.</p>

<p>Black color-and-varnish, a popular coating up and surfacing material
for vehicle bodies and running parts, is best used upon all the lighter grade
of bodies by tipping them so that the side panels at least present a flat,
upturned surface, the device, <a href="#Fig_1_09">Fig. 9</a>, in Chapter I. of this work, being used
effectively for holding such bodies in position. The half elastic brush, flat
and chisel pointed, is the most available tool for flowing the color-and-varnish
on bodies. For applying the black color-and-varnish to running
parts, the camel's-hair flowing brush is an easy and fine working tool and is
principally used for that purpose in many foremost carriage paint shops.
Like all color-and-varnish, the black variety should be furnished with a
ground free from defects, and should be used simply for the enrichment of
that ground, to give it depth, density, and an intense jet black color. Such
an achievement is impossible through the agency of color coats and clear
rubbing varnish coats, pure and simple.</p>


<h3>WHITE.</h3>

<p>The application of white to a surface and the development of a solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
white job thereby is certainly one of the highly skilled features of the trade.
The most fitting reference to white would seem to be best made by
describing the method used in painting and finishing a vehicle surface in
white.</p>

<p>First clean the wood thoroughly, removing all stains, discolorations,
etc. Then carefully brush on a coat of raw linseed oil. Seek to have a
uniform film of the oil over all parts of the surface. When the surface is
ready to recoat, make sure by a careful inspection of it that all parts are
sufficiently well sandpapered. Then apply a coat of white keg lead mixed
<span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> oil to <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> turps, with a teaspoonful of pale japan added to each quart of
the mixture. The second coat of white is best mixed with, say about <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">16</span> of
oil to <span class="fnum">13</span>/<span class="fden">16</span> of turps. This quantity of oil suffices to give the white a stout
binder without affecting the purity of the white. Puttying and whatever
putty glazing is necessary should be done on the first coat of white. Make
the putty of dry white lead mixed to the proper consistency in very pale
rubbing varnish, 1 part; gold size japan, 2 parts. For stopping holes, the
putty needs to be a good bit stiffer than when used for the general run of
disfigurements; for glazing, thin to the desired consistency with turps.
Sandpaper lightly and then mix Florence, flake, or cremnitz white to a
consistency that will render the color free working under a half elastic, soft
bristle brush, using turps for the thinner, and hard drying finishing varnish
for the binder. Apply two coats of this color, taking due care to have the
color laid smooth and free from brush marks. Then take the hard drying
finishing varnish and add to it enough of the white to "kill" the yellowish
amber color of the varnish, and flow on a full, free, uniform coat. When
dry, rub with pulverized pumice stone and water, clean up thoroughly, and
apply a second coat of the color-and-varnish. Rub and clean up as before,
and apply a third coat. This coat will probably suffice to furnish a solid and
pure white surface, fine and smooth, and of becoming lustre. If the job is
to go with a full varnish gloss, and striping or other ornamenting is desired,
it can be done on this finishing coat, and pencil varnished.</p>

<p>In case gold, silver, aluminum, or other leaf is used in ornamenting,
the finish should, preferably, be done in a simple gloss or flat, as it will be
found extremely difficult to successfully apply leaf over a finished surface of
high lustre. If the finish is to be gloss or flat, give the last coat of varnish
adequate time to dry hard, say ten days at least, and then first rub with
pumice stone and water, wash and dry up carefully, after which rub with
rotten stone and sweet oil, using a piece of chamois skin for the rubbing pad.
In rubbing, avoid heating the varnish, otherwise a roughened, shredded
surface will result. For cleaning up the oil and rotten stone, dust wheat
flour or pulverized slippery elm over the surface, flick off with a soft duster,
and wipe dry with a clean piece of silk. In the painting and finishing of a
white surface, the subjoined rules hold good:</p>

<p>Avoid using the color too thick. Thinner coats and more of them are best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>After the first, or priming, coat, use as sparingly of oil as possible. Oil
produces "yellowing" of the white.</p>

<p>Abstain from the use of zinc white or damar varnish altogether. They
are alike shifty and unreliable as applied to the processes of carriage and
wagon painting.</p>

<p>Care should be observed to keep the surface flawless and perfectly clean.
To this end, clean apartments, clean brushes, chamois skins, sponges, etc.,
may be classed as imperative necessities.</p>

<p>The Florence, flake, or cremnitz white above recommended should be
used in the painting of all first-class white surfaces. Ordinary white lead is
advised only when the cheaper grade of white surfaces is desired.</p>

<p>If broad, flat surfaces are to be painted and a strictly first-class job is
demanded, a roughstuff will be necessary. Formulas for roughstuff or
white filler are as follows:</p>

<p>Formula No. 1.&mdash;Dry white lead, <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; whiting, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>. Liquids, pale
rubbing varnish, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; turpentine, <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; gold size japan, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> gill.</p>

<p>Formula No. 2.&mdash;Dry white lead, 1 part; pulverized soapstone, 2 parts;
pulverized pumice stone, 1 part. Liquids, rubbing varnish, 1 part; turpentine,
1 part; tablespoonful of gold size japan to each quart of the filler when
mixed.</p>

<p>Formula No. 3.&mdash;Dry white lead mixed to a thick paste in <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> pale
rubbing varnish and <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> gold size japan. Reduce to a brushing consistency
with turps.</p>

<p>Apply one coat of either of the above fillers per day and regulate the
number of coats to suit the condition of the surface. To the final coat add
a little lemon yellow as a guide in rubbing out. A dash of pulverized
pumice stone may also be given the 'stuff (especially that made by the third
formula) to make it surface free and clear under the rubbing stone. In
rubbing out, "eternal vigilance" and plenty of care and caution are factors
of the utmost importance, if scratching and disfiguring the surface would
be avoided. Then over this rubbed surface apply flat coats of the white,
reinforced with a binder of hard drying varnish, following with color-and-varnish
and other finishing processes as above directed.</p>

<p>While roughstuff must continue to be recognized as a necessity in the
development of white surfaces of certain grades, sizes, and forms, the
painter, in so far as possible, may well decide to discard its employment
solely owing to a lack of durability as compared to the regulation method of
building up with color and color-and-varnish coats to a solid and firmly-welded
finish.</p>

<p>There is another method of painting white practiced by many first-class
painters, which was first published in <cite>Varnish</cite> and written by that
reliable and experienced authority, Mr. J. G. Cameron. It consists of
priming the wood with the best white lead, mixed with as much oil as the
wood will absorb, and turpentine. This is given five days in which to dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Then white lead is made up to dry with a gloss, and two coats of the
mixture is given, with an interval of one day between coats. The surface
is then puttied with a putty made of white keg lead, dry white lead and
whiting, equal parts by bulk, and japan. The putty used for knifing in is
made softer than that used for stopping holes and cavities. The putty is
given one day to harden. Then a filling composed of keg lead, 1 part;
whiting, 1 part; flour of pumice stone, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">5</span> part; made into a stiff glazing
pigment with japan and a small percentage of turpentine, is brushed over
the surface, a second workman following with a broad putty knife and
skillfully removing the superfluous filler. This glazing is intended only for
panels and flat work generally. Permit this filling to dry forty-eight hours.
It is then rubbed lightly with pumice stone. Moldings and carved work are
sandpapered. Next, to 5 lbs. of white keg lead, highest quality, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> pint of
good wearing body varnish that dries quickly and reliably is added. The
mass is then thinned with turps and strained. This dries to a little more
than an egg-shell gloss. Five coats of this color are applied on five consecutive
days, no rubbing or sandpapering being done between coats. This
foundation of white is given a week, to harden, after which it is thoroughly
rubbed down with about No. <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> pulverized pumice stone. It is then
allowed to stand two days before being polished and cleaned up with flour of
pumice stone. A coat of high grade and practically colorless finishing
varnish (now procurable of the leading varnish makers) is now flowed on
and the work is complete. The color for the five coats is made up at one
time, so that it dries and hardens equally and uniformly throughout. Mr.
Cameron vouches for the durability, fullness, and solidity of a white surface
painted by this method, having employed it in painting hundreds of street
cars, in addition to a great many hearses, delivery wagons, etc. It is a well-known
practical fact that a first-class finishing varnish and white lead carefully
mixed solidifies amazingly throughout. And the one coat of very pale
or colorless finishing varnish over all produces the effect of a high grade
finish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">APPLYING RUBBING VARNISH&mdash;SURFACING VARNISH&mdash;CARE OF THE
FINISHING ROOM WASHING THE RUBBED SURFACES&mdash;FLOWING
THE FINISHING COAT.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">One well-known varnish maker has said that the marvelous thing
about carriage varnish is that it must be one garment suited to all
kinds of weather. As a material destined to shine in the public eye,
its proper manipulation and treatment is manifestly of the first importance to
the carriage painter. No other material with which the painter has to do is
so sensitive to the robust variety of influences constantly attacking it as
varnish. The virtues of a first-class varnish which add to its durability, increase
its brilliancy, and in other ways enhance the beauty of a surface over
which it is used are the ones that impart to it a peculiar sensitiveness characteristic
of no other material. Briefly, then, we may sum up the task of
applying and manipulating varnish upon a carriage surface as a delicate
job. A workman of fine notions, intelligent, painstaking and highly skilled
in the handling of the proper tools, is the only successful varnisher. Such a
workman is required to get all that is true and fine and lasting and lovely
out of the employment of varnish. In the varnishing of a vehicle the first
kind of varnish we are required to use is rubbing varnish. The duty of
putting on rubbing varnish is less difficult, practically considered, than that
of flowing the finishing coat, but rubbing varnish bespeaks deft and skillful
handling. The first coat of rubbing demands to be applied quite as precisely,
and with the same thoroughness as to details, as would mark the application
of any of the later coats. In the application of the first and second
rubbing coats to body surfaces, the bodies, when of a build to permit of the
practice, should be tipped so as to offer a flat, upturned surface, a device for
holding the bodies in this position having been illustrated in <a href="#Chapter_01">Chapter I</a>.
Fuller and finer rubbing coats may be flowed on when the bodies are tipped.
Tipping of all the lighter forms of vehicle bodies is practiced in leading
shops when applying the first and second rubbing coats.</p>

<p>The writer, therefore, advises observance of the practice in even the
smallest of shops. There is less chance for brushmarks and other defects
manifesting themselves. With the heavily flowed on rubbing coats, the
round, full surface which distinguishes the product of the best varnish rooms
is obtained at a less expenditure of time and labor, than when the thinner
coats are employed. I would suggest the full, heavy rubbing coat as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
most effective aid in avoiding brushmarks and in drowning out the dust
motes and flocculent matter to be noted as part and parcel of the skimpy
brushed on coat of varnish. The modern ethics of carriage painting affirms
the excellence of heavy rubbing coats of varnish as the most enduring base
for heavy finishing coats.</p>

<p>The final rubbing coat may best be applied with the vehicle body occupying
its natural position or, rather, the position it is to occupy when the
coat of finishing goes on. This is the coat that is depended upon to reflect
the outline and round out the fullness of the finishing varnish. The necessity
of its being perfect in all the respects that it is possible to make a rubbing
coat of varnish, is, therefore, apparent. The fact that varnish goes on
pretty nearly everything, brightens
it, keeps it clean and cleanable,
covers it, takes the wear,
prolongs its life, and increases its
beauty and usefulness, furnishes
the carriage painter with a substantial
reason for insisting upon
having his rubbing coats, from
first to last, deftly placed and
shrewdly balanced.</p>


<h3>THE SURFACING OF RUBBING
VARNISH.</h3>

<p>When a rubbing varnish has
been given the full limit of time
recommended by the manufacturer
in which to harden, surfacing
should ensue. To permit
such varnish to remain unprotected
from the atmospheric
impurities common to the average
paint shop may be accepted
as an actual detriment to the durability of the surface. The gums used in
rubbing varnish and which unite to give it a surfacing property render the
varnish when spread upon a surface peculiarly susceptible to the attacks of
all forms of impurities. Hence the necessity of surfacing the rubbing coats
as soon as they have been given adequate time to harden. The supporting
strength and ability of such coats are thereby promoted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_047.jpg" width="300" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Varnish Stand.</span><br />As used in some factory shops.</div>
</div>

<p>To surface varnish correctly and at the minimum outlay of time, it is
needful that a serviceable equipment of tools be furnished the workman.
This should consist of at least two good pails (galvanized iron pails are
probably the most economical), half dozen good, soft sponges, a water tool,
and a few first-class chamois skins, in addition to plenty of rubbing pads.
Rubbing pads are often shop made from waste cuttings of broadcloth or felt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the strips being rolled into cylindrical form or fastened around blocks of
wood. However, the most effective rubbing pads are procurable direct from
the manufacturers and come in the form of thick perforated pads, running
in thickness from <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> to 1 inch, and in size from 2×3 inches to 3×4 inches.
These perforated pads serve to free the surface from that part of the pulverized
pumice stone which, during the process of rubbing, has become inert
and a hindrance to the leveling efforts of the workman.</p>

<p>In surfacing, pulverized pumice stone of the 0 or 00 grade of fineness is
best.</p>

<p>The water supply is an important factor in varnish surfacing, soft water
being a highly-valued essential. A surface cleans up better with soft water
than when the water used is hard. If plenty of soft water is not forthcoming,
add a little soda to the water, say a teaspoonful of soda to an ordinary
pail of water. This will reduce the harshness of the water.</p>

<p>The actual work of rubbing or surfacing varnish may be classed as an
art. The first class varnish rubber is really an accomplished mechanic. Before
beginning to rub a surface, first rinse it off with clean water. This by
way of a precaution. Then dip the rubbing pad first lightly into the water
to moisten it, and then into the pumice stone, thus carrying it to the surface
where with light pressured sweeps it may be spread over a certain part of
the surface. Rub lightly at first, gradually increasing the pressure until
the necessary force is reached. First rub the outside edges of a panel and
the mouldings, if any, finishing up the central part last. It will be found
easier to get the center of a panel, or of a given portion of a surface, rubbed
sufficiently than to get the outer edges of it done. If a large surface is being
rubbed, first rub a certain space for a time and then shift to a new space,
thus avoiding the possibility of unduly heating the surface. Alternate between
the two spaces until the desired reduction of the surface has been
reached. Upon surfaces which admit of carrying the rubbing strokes to the
extreme end of the panel, the rubbing strokes being always directed lengthwise
of the panel, do not cross rub at the ends. Cross rubbing at panel ends
is invariably shunned by first-class factory varnish rubbers, and these specialists
are deservedly classed as artists in their line. For example, upon
piano box bodies the strokes are carried quite to the end of the panel, with
no cross brushing tolerated. First coatings of varnish do not invite very
close surfacing. The second coat permits, and should receive, the solid and
close surfacing. The final rubbing coat should properly require only a
moderate degree of surfacing to make it fit to hold out the finishing coat
with becoming comeliness. Avoid using too much pumice stone, too much
water, or too much pressure on the pad; in a word, avoid excesses. Pumice
stone and water should not be allowed to dry upon the surface. It is a
hazardous practice. Have plenty of clean water at hand and wash the surface
up tidily as fast as the rubbing proceeds. Adhere to uniformity and
thoroughness in surfacing. The surface rubbed more closely in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
places than in others, and not rubbed sufficiently thorough as to corners,
border spaces, etc., bears the unmistakable imprint of the bungler's rude
hand. Probably this rule of uniformity and thoroughness is the most difficult
for the beginner to acquire. It really covers nearly the whole range of
the art of fine surfacing. When one has mastered the feat of rubbing a surface
to the same uniform depth of film, missing never a modest slip on molding,
around bolt head, or other easily overlooked space, he has earned the
right to strive for the expert's rank.</p>

<p>The surface once rubbed, washing up must needs follow. The workman
cannot be too greatly impressed with the importance of this branch of
the work. Thorough washing must necessarily accompany thorough rubbing;
otherwise, the efforts of the rubber go for naught. To insure clean
washing of the surface, clean tools must be maintained. The chamois skins,
sponges, wash brushes, etc., require storage in some dust-proof
receptacle. This may be in the form of a cupboard
or small closet, or a bag made of light rubber cloth and
provided with a shirring string. Wash these articles often
in soap and water, rinsing carefully in clean water after
applying and rubbing in the soap. This method will aid
to keep them clean. With clean pails, clean water, and
clean washing and drying tools, the task of washing a
surface preparatory to varnishing is deprived of many of
its menacing features. The final washing up should, in
every instance, be performed with a pail, brush, chamois
skin, and sponge kept expressly for that purpose and used
for no other. Always keep in store a sponge and chamois
skin to be used especially for washing and drying out the
inside of vehicle bodies. Another set, separate and independent
of the others, should be devoted solely to washing
and drying up vehicle running parts for the varnisher.
In cleaning up a carriage body for varnishing, first wash
out the inside surface, tooling out all the corners, etc., with the water tool.
Then apply plenty of water to the outside, washing the sill and border of the
under surface of the body fully as free and clean as the more exposed parts.
Thoroughly tool around all bolt-heads or other parts which offer a lodgment
for atoms of pumice stone. After tooling about such surface fixtures, follow
immediately with a sponge well loaded with water, thus flooding out the
loosened accumulations of gritty matter. The body being finally washed
clean, top, bottom, inside, and out, dry up carefully with the chamois skin,
and then at once set away in that sacred place, the varnish room.</p>

<p>To summarize the features of surfacing varnish, note: First. Use roll or
blocked broadcloth or felt rubbing pads.</p>

<p>Second. Direct the rubbing strokes all in one direction, and lengthwise
of the panel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Third. Avoid excessive use of pumice stone or water, and indulge in
not too heavily applied pressure of the rubbing cloth. Moderate pressure,
uniformly sustained, is the correct practice.</p>

<p>Fourth. Maintain constantly, and at all times, a conspicuously clean
washing up kit; and in washing the surface do not stop short of having it
unmistakably and shiningly clean.</p>

<p>Thereby hangs the tale of fine varnishing made easy.</p>

<p>If jobs are rubbed out of varnish and allowed to stand over night before
being varnished, a final light rubbing should be given the surface just previous
to applying the varnish. A surface when rubbed and stood aside for
a short time takes on a scum which, if not removed, is fatal to good varnish-room
results. This scum is said to be caused by the oxidation of the floating
matter, from the oxide contained in it and the oxygen in the atmosphere.
The scum acts in the nature of a deadly blight upon the varnish applied
directly upon it, begetting many of what are commonly known as the depravities
of varnish. Rotten stone applied and rubbed under a piece of carriage
head-lining broadcloth makes an excellent polish to remove all scum
from the surface.</p>


<h3>FLOWING THE FINISHING COATS.</h3>

<p>To accomplish high grade finishing, certain varnish room conditions
must prevail. The varnish room must have plenty of light, ventilation,
warmth, and dryness of atmosphere. Cleanliness must abound;&mdash;personal
cleanliness, room cleanliness, and cleanliness of stock and tool equipment.
Ventilation and light have already been alluded to. To sweep the varnish
room floor, first profusely sprinkle with well dampened sawdust, and beginning
at one side sweep in a windrow. Do not use much water upon the
varnish room floor, unless it should chance to be a perfectly tight floor and
fit to be mopped out occasionally. Then the mopping out should occur
upon days when there is to be no varnishing done in the department. A
thermometer to register the heat and a hygrometer to register the humidity
should be inseparable inmates of the varnish room.</p>

<p>A cupboard set in even with the wall or partition of the room should
contain clean cups, strainer, dusters, along with the brushes in their air-tight
keepers. Maintain a uniform temperature of from 75° to 80° Fahr.</p>

<p>Insist upon the surfaces and the varnish to be applied to them being of
the same degree of temperature. In this way only will varnish work at its
best.</p>

<p>Remove the stopper from the varnish can a short time prior to beginning
to varnish. This allows for the escape of certain gases generated in
the varnish can.</p>

<p>Although the varnish maker may declare his varnishes do not need
straining it is really the safer rule to strain all the finishing varnish before
using. A majority of finishers in our best shops persist in the practice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Patent strainers are now on the market adopted for this very purpose.
Cheese cloth, cut in squares and drawn over funnel-shaped tins, serves as
cheap and quickly arranged strainers.</p>

<p>Be thorough and painstaking in dusting. After the first dusting go
over the surface with a piece of silk. Next, give all spots rubbed through,
or which promise to show badly under the varnish, a dash of color, immediately
slicking these color patches over with a small piece of cotton rag.
Now varnish the inside of the body, having previously, of course, rubbed or
mossed off this part of the job, as the desired quality of the finish may dictate,
and dusted it carefully. The inside surface being finished, again dust
the outside surface. Then for the final dusting take a round or oval duster,
kept expressly for the purpose, and, moistening the hollow
of the left hand with a little finishing varnish, flick the
point of the duster over this to furnish it with a dust
attraction property, after which proceed at once to dust
carefully the surface to be varnished.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_b_051.jpg" width="100" height="354" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thermometer</span>&mdash;The
varnish room watch dog.</div>
</div>

<p>The surface now being ready to finish, remove the
brushes from the keeper, fill the varnish cup one-third full
of the strained varnish, and follow this <i lang="la" xml:lang="lar">modus operandi</i>,
assuming, for example, the job to be of the piano box
pattern: With the 1-inch badger hair brush lay the varnish
along the bottom of the main panel, then across both
ends, and lastly, along the top, taking in the seat riser
while flowing the top edge. Then with the <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>-inch brush
<em>flow</em>, not brush, the varnish over the main surface space.
Hold the brush, in flowing, rather flat. Keep it well
charged with varnish, and pass it lightly and with a steady
stroke from one end of the panel to the other, applying
and laying off with horizontal strokes of the brush. From
the brush held and directed in this way the varnish flows
full and rich upon the surface, the distribution being more
even and uniform, and less cross brushing becoming, therefore,
assured. When the finishing brush is held at a steep
angle, or in such a way that the points of the bristles are forced to
mainly do the work, the varnish is whipped into motion to a harmful extent,
requiring thereby more manipulation with the brush to get it evenly
placed, and consequently destroying some of its natural fullness and brilliancy.
The chief aim of the carriage finisher is to so first flow his varnish
that the minimum outlay of cross brushing and dressing up will suffice, to
the end that the varnish may be disturbed as little as possible, thus securing
that depth of lustre and mirror-like effects so greatly cherished by all first-class
finishers.</p>

<p>In varnishing piano style bodies and surfaces of close kith and kin to
such, flow at least one side and an end before cross brushing and laying off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The varnish, by this method, is given time to take on a bit of "tack," as it
were, and in cross brushing a less quantity is removed than would be the
case if cross brushing were to follow directly upon completion of flowing the
panel. After cross brushing and laying off, "catch up" the edges and all
other places where the varnish is liable to start into a run or an overflow.</p>

<p>In varnishing surreys, phaetons, and jobs of that order, and larger, the
varnisher should determine the amount of space he may flow before returning
to cross brush, by the working qualities of his varnish, room temperature,
and the prevailing circumstance at the time of varnishing.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_b_052.jpg" width="150" height="391" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Varnish Strainer.</span><br />
Published by permission
of "The Carriage
Monthly."</div>
</div>

<p>After cross brushing, go over the panel but once in laying off. As before
stated, and as expert carriage finishers everywhere
will assert, the less brushing and disturbing of varnish,
once it is flowed on the surface, the finer the body and
brilliancy of the finish.</p>

<p>To become an expert body finisher the workman
should possess varnish intelligence. He should know
how to keep cool; be an absolute stranger to varnish
fright, never lacking for confidence or ability to successfully
meet and master emergencies as they arise. The
art of varnishing cannot be acquired in a day, or an
hour, or simply by a studious perusal of carefully
worded directions. These serve as a working draft,
but must be supplemented by long-continued practice,
and, in case of carriage body finishing, coupled with a
natural aptitude for the work.</p>


<h3>VARNISHING RUNNING PARTS.</h3>

<p>The running parts of a vehicle having rounded surfaces
are more easily made to shine fine and mirror-like
than are the body surfaces. However, the varnishing
of running parts may rightfully be classed a highly
skilled operation. Washing up and cleaning the running
parts preparatory to varnishing is a difficult task.
Around clips, bolt heads, axle ties, etc., pumice stone
and dirt accumulations cling tenaciously, and thorough tooling with
the wash brush and plenty of water is needed to fit such parts for varnishing.
After washing, and once dusting over the running parts, touch with
color all reaches of surface requiring it. When color patches are dry take a
second duster, kept for this one dusting only, flip it lightly over the varnish-moistened
left palm, and go over the surface carefully. If a particularly fine
job, pass over the surface with the palms of the hands, having previously
given them a slight wetting with the finishing varnish. This method illustrates
the power of magnetic influence, and catches up flotillas of dust motes
which the duster would possibly disturb, but not remove. In finishing the
gear begin at the front axle and proceed to flow the whole front end before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
wiping up. This gives the varnish a chance to take its position on the surface,
and the wiping up serves to level out the inequalities and remove the surplus.
After the front, the rear, then the reach, and last the side bars, if
any. A brush should be kept solely to wipe up the underside of axles, head
blocks, spring bars, side bars, etc. In many factory shops the finishers
wipe such parts with the palm of their hand. The varnish drippings are
thus caught by the hand and distributed in the form of a glaze to the parts
in question.</p>

<p>In varnishing wheels, which are always included in the term running
parts, slip the wheel upon the revolving jack and, standing with the left side
nearest the wheel and partly facing it, begin by flowing the sides and face
of the spokes, reaching the brush well over to the back surface of the
spokes. Then flow front of hub. Next the inside and face of the felloe.
Now whirl the wheel so that its rear surface takes the place of the front.
Catch up and close in with varnish all strips on the rear surface of spokes
not flowed when the sides were done. Then flow rear of hub, and lastly,
the back surface of felloe. Reverse position of wheel, slick up all places
needing it, and set away on a second wheel jack, giving the wheel a sharp
spin to better hold the flowed-on varnish in place. Four wheel jacks are
necessary to flow wheels properly. Then, when the fourth jack is occupied,
the wheel first done, having been given a good spinning and at least three
half turns, may be set away in the rack, subject to no danger from runs or
sags. When applying rubbing varnish it is advisable to flow not more than
six or eight spokes before wiping up. About this proportion of surface for
flowing and then wiping up should control in applying rubbing varnish to
running parts.</p>

<h3>GRAINING OUT.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The peculiar grain showing a condition of the surface which manifests itself
after the job is finished arises from certain incompetent practices
observed along in the early stages of painting, or from the use of
wood not adapted to the needs of vehicle construction, as, for example, sappy
or unseasoned wood. It is a principle of fine surfacing, substantiated by
experience, that when a carriage body has been perfectly smoothed and
leveled by the woodworker, it should be given a few hours, say four or five,
before priming. This delay is to give the wood, subjected to unusual
pressure during the surfacing process, an opportunity to expand and shape
itself into a normal conformation. Upon high grade work it would be a good
practice to first level thoroughly and set away in an unquestionably dry
atmosphere for a few hours, and then have the woodworker apply a second
sandpapering. Then after another interval of a few hours, prime thoroughly
inside and out, top and bottom; in fact, wherever moisture might
possibly find an entrance.</p>

<p>Graining out may come from priming too closely upon the completion
of the woodworker's leveling process; or it may come from the dry wood
having been exposed, after the surfacing process, to a "spell" of damp
weather. The dry, porous timber absorbs enough wetness to raise the grain
to such an extent that nothing short of a resurfacing will restore it to its
normal smooth and perfect condition again. This wood, with its erect
fibres or grain fairly visible to the eye upon a casual examination, if painted
over and finished, dries out in time, and in doing so responds to the natural
law of shrinkage.</p>

<p>Shrinkage involves a process whereby the priming, roughstuff, color,
varnish, etc., apparently goes in while the grain of the wood goes out.
Graining out is often due to a priming coat that is not given adequate time
to dry hard and firm. This soft layer of rather slow drying pigment, if
sealed from contact with the air prematurely, is a powerful inducement to
grain showing. Spongy, porous roughstuff, deficient in resinous matter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
weak in its binding property, is also often responsible for graining out.
Good reliable priming, lead and roughstuff coats, allowed to dry thoroughly,
each and all of them, arrest the graining out tendency. Improperly seasoned
wood is a prolific producer of grained out surfaces.</p>

<p>Moisture confined under a body of paint and varnish is bound to make
its exit right speedily, and this it does by voraciously sucking the paint and
varnish material in and pushing the grain of the wood out.</p>


<h3>CRACKING.</h3>

<p>It has been said that the natural destiny of varnish is to crack. When
a varnish has worn itself out, lost its elasticity, become brittle, it will,
despite the best laid plans of men and science, fissure and crack. In so doing
it simply responds to a natural law. The cracking that occurs prior to this
period of service is of supreme concern to the painter. Probably the greatest
cause of varnish cracking&mdash;the cause that towers above all other causes&mdash;is
developed by the hurried system of painting&mdash;forcing one coat over another
not perfectly dry. Imperfectly dried rubbing coats, or a lack of uniformity
in the selection of the varnishes used, often cause cracking. For example,
a quick drying
rubbing varnish,
or a hard drying
finishing, even,
is employed,
over which a
slow drying,
elastic finishing
is used. Antagonism between the varnish coats, or between the varnish
and color coats; improperly adjusted foundation coats; exposure to sudden
atmospheric changes, including excessive heat; the action of ammonia; poor
material&mdash;all of these are underlying causes of varnish cracking. Imperfectly
seasoned panels or moisture penetrating thin wood panels will tend to
crack the varnish used over such surfaces. The cracks in varnish due to a
continued straining of the panels are termed "force cracks."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_b_055.jpg" width="450" height="152" alt="Carriage Body with Cracks" />
</div>

<p>Force cracks are usually found just over the steps on the carriage body,
running in long, circular lines, also on the panels under the seat riser, and
on the seat riser. The vibration of light, insecurely stiffened carriage bodies
is generally a direct cause of premature cracking of varnish. The accompanying
cut of a buggy body shows the usual location and sweep of force
cracks. This class of surface fissures is very easily distinguished from those
due to causes previously mentioned.</p>


<h3>SWEATING.</h3>

<p>Sweating is the taking on of a gloss after the varnish coat has been
rubbed. The principal cause of varnish sweating is rubbing it before it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sufficiently hardened. Varnish laid over a coat of color or of varnish that
lacks somewhat of being dry is prone to sweat. When a coat of varnish has
been rubbed and allowed to stand for some time&mdash;over night, say,&mdash;in a close
paint or varnish room atmosphere, it will take on a sort of a gloss or greasy
scum which comes under the head of sweating. It would be in the highest
degree dangerous to permanent or brilliant results to flow a coat of varnish
directly over a sweaty surface. The sweat that overspreads a rubbed
varnish surface by reason of the absorption of atmospheric impurities can be
quickly removed by lightly rubbing with a little rotten stone and water.
The sweating out of a surface rubbed before it has adequately hardened can
only be remedied by allowing the surface to become hard and then
re-rubbing.</p>


<h3>DEADENING, SINKING IN, ETC.</h3>

<p>This describes a varnish when it goes "flat," loses its lustre, and refuses
to shine in the public eye. The causes of this trouble are, briefly; unseasoned
timber, imperfectly dried under coats, such as, for illustration, a
four-day rubbing varnish surfaced and finished over after permitting the
rubbing only two days in which to dry. Porous under coats which absorb
too great a percentage of the oil of the varnish cause deadening; and porous
under coats, let us bear in mind, produce by far the larger share of varnish
deadening.</p>


<h3>PITTING.</h3>

<p>Pitting transforms a film of varnish into an expanse of minute indentations
or pits, and simply represents in an aggravated form what is commonly
known as pin-holing. The depravity is caused by a lack of uniformity in
atmospheric conditions during the drying process, such as from warm to
cold, dry to moist; mixing varnish of various grades; varnishing over a
sweaty surface or over imperfectly dried color or varnish coats, or in an
apartment having an excessively wet floor, or during a day of unusual
moisture. Pitting may also come from varnishing over a surface rubbed
through to the under coats. Varnish charged with gaseous impurities, or a
varnish not sufficiently ripened, is powerfully inclined to pit. Dirty varnish,
sometimes ditto. Soap or grease smears will cause pitting, as will also too
oily under coats. Draughts of cold air have been known to cause bad cases
of pitting.</p>


<h3>ENAMELING, SILKING, ETC.</h3>

<p>Applied to a varnish surface when it assumes the appearance of enameled
leather or silk. Varnish used upon a hot, humid, moist, sticky day often
goes silky or enamels. Dog day conditions usually invite enameling or
silking. Varnish put on in a cold room is liable to enamel. Brushing
varnish too long, adding turpentine to it, using an oil-saturated brush or
mixing different makes or grades of varnish cause the depravities here
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>SEEDY OR SPECKY.</h3>

<p>Caused by want of thoroughness in cleaning and dusting a surface
preparatory to varnishing. Likewise by the skinning over of a varnish, the
broken particles of the skin then working into the liquid and thence
conveyed to the surface. Also by using an unripe varnish, or a chilled
varnish, or by varnishing on a cold, damp day in a room not properly
heated.</p>

<p>The "lousy" or dirty varnish brush begets the seedy, specky work. It
is a fruitful cause of such work, in fact.</p>


<h3>CRAWLING.</h3>

<p>When a varnish, after having been spread upon a surface, contracts,
picks itself up into patches, and otherwise vanishes from parts of the surface
which should continue to reflect its lustre, it is said to have crawled.
Causes: Putting it over a color or varnish ground not quite dry; using oil
in the color-and-varnish, or using oil in the color coat to give it a decided
egg-shell gloss; handling the work with greasy hands or washing it with
water in the slightest degree soapy or fatty. Probably the egg-shell gloss,
however, is the most prolific cause of varnish crawling. To remedy this
trouble wash the work with clean water, dry off with the chamois skin, and
varnish immediately.</p>


<h3>WRINKLING, CRINKLING, ETC.</h3>

<p>These are caused by putting on a too heavy coat of varnish, or by not
dressing it out and wiping it up properly; also by using a varnish not
sufficiently ripened. A varnish which shows wrinkling or crinkling while
standing in a warm room may be made to assume an aggravated form of the
trouble by simply transferring the work to a cold apartment. In the case of
varnish wrinkling or crinkling, methods of prevention are preferable to any
system of cure.</p>


<h3>RUNS, SAGS, CURTAINS, DRAPERIES, ETC.</h3>

<p>Some of the causes which develop the depravities outlined in the
foregoing paragraph are responsible for those at the head of this one. Other
causes are: Lack of uniformity in the application of the varnish, one brushful
of the liquid being nicely worked out and the next one being the reverse, or
the varnish being applied heavier on one part of the surface than on another,
or too heavy a coat serving as the predominate feature throughout.
Careless, incomplete wiping up around mouldings, bolt-heads, nuts, and
fixtures of that order, generates runs, sags, etc. To reduce these deviltries,
first rub with water and pulverized pumice stone. Then pare off a few
shavings from a bar of common house soap, dip the rubbing pad freshly
coated with pumice stone into the shreds of the alkaline compound, and rub
briskly over the offending deviltry. After using the soap, rinse off with
clean water very thoroughly. Then rub lightly with rotten stone and wash
thoroughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>RIDGING, ROUGHING.</h3>

<p>These terms are given to a surface that resembles a corrugated panel,
showing a ridgy, furrowy expanse. Timidity or the spirit of the painter-afraid-of-his-varnish
provokes this lamentable surface condition. After the
varnish has set past a certain tack and the brush is then drawn through it,
roughing and ridging occurs. When one falls heir to this mishap, take a
soft badger-hair brush and, procuring a small quantity of turpentine, proceed
to apply the fluid plentifully over the panel. This will quickly soften the
coat of varnish so that by wiping the brush carefully out, the loosened
varnish can be easily brushed off and the surface immediately revarnished.</p>


<h3>PERISHING, CRUMBLING, RUSTING.</h3>

<p>By this we mean a gradual loss of lustre, the final result of which is a
disruption of the surface ending in a complete destruction of the varnish.
Washing with water heated beyond the tepid degree is an engaging bid for
the disaster here noted. Ammonia fumes, coal gas, salt sea air, soil of
limestone localities, etc., cause varnish to perish and crumble away.</p>


<h3>CHIPPING, FLAKING, PEELING.</h3>

<p>The separation of one varnish coat, or certain parts of it, from another,
or from a coat of color is known as "chipping," "flaking," or "peeling."
Causes: Moisture in the wood; imperfectly dried under coats; grease and
smoke from the smithshop; failure to maintain the proper elasticity between
the successive color or varnish coats. It is very probable that the most
active and effective cause arises from the use of adulterated turpentine,
inferior japan, and a poor, low quality material generally.</p>


<h3>FIRE CHECKS.</h3>

<p>These consist of a delicate tracery of almost invisible fissures radiating
every which way. The displeasing effects of fire checks are not fully
disclosed until the finishing varnish has been laid. An extra coat or two
of rubbing varnish will usually suffice to conceal all traces of a moderate
array of fire checks.</p>


<h3>GREENING.</h3>

<p>This comes from the use of too many clear rubbing or finishing coats of
varnish to a black surface. Successive coats of clear rubbing varnish,
capped with a heavy coat of finishing, applied over a black japan ground,
affords a pronounced and, in some respects, enticing shade of green.
Greening of a varnish surface is also effected by confining the freshly
varnished work in a dark apartment while the drying is going on. When
the work is fit to remove from the varnish drying room, in order to intensify
the greening, it may be stored in a dark room or repository for a time.
Recently varnished surfaces held for a few weeks in dark apartments green
rapidly. Prevention: Use black color-and-varnish over black color grounds.
Add a dash of black color to each of the clear rubbing coats up to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
including the final rubbing. Furnish the drying room with plenty of light
on all sides, and, so far as possible, insist vigorously upon the necessity of
light, airy carriage houses and repositories.</p>


<h3>BLOOMING.</h3>

<p>Blooming is a whitish, metallic-like film, like unto the bloom on a plum
or peach, which obscures the brilliancy of the varnish. It is variously
known in the trade as going cloudy, smoky, or foggy. Varnish surfaces
exposed to a moist atmosphere, to smoke, or to the fumes of the blacksmith
shop are apt to bloom. If the blooming is of recent origin, a thorough
washing and drying off with the "shammy" will generally restore the lustre
of the varnish. If of long standing and therefore of a virulent type, the only
effectual remedy is rubbing with pulverized pumice stone and water and
re-varnishing.</p>


<h3>BLISTERS.</h3>

<p>The varnish surface, dry or apparently so, when afflicted with little
eruptions, after the fashion of pustules on the human cuticle, is said to have
blistered. The disease is caused by moisture in the wood, exposure to the
intense rays of the sun during the early days of service, or to the presence
of oil or grease on the surface directly under the finishing coat or between
any of the preceding coats of varnish or color. Soft under coats develop
blisters, their development through this medium being in this wise: Coats
of lead, heavy in body, and perchance a bit fatty or gummy, are applied to
the surface. Such coats do not dry <em>thoroughly</em>. Oil in color coats tends to
the same result. They deceive the workman, being apparently dry, but not
really, when choked up under subsequent coatings. A surface so builded is
eventually put into service and submitted to the sunlight. Warmed by the
heat, these undried particles of color or lead quickly respond to the law of
expansion. The varnish, supple and full of elasticity, instead of cracking
and splitting into fissures, simply swells up with the paint. Fierce stove or
steam heat causes blisters. A varnish blister, if not located upon a too
prominent portion of the surface, may be reduced to a surface fracture easily
overlooked, by puncturing with a needle and then pressing the rupture
down with a wet sponge.</p>


<h3>SPOTTING.</h3>

<p>There are several forms of this ailment, viz., mud spotting, soapy or
dirty water spotting, and the spotting caused by strong currents of air
beating powerfully upon the varnish surface. Mud spotting is by far the
most malignant type of the depravity herein mentioned. An elastic high
grade varnish is more susceptible to the poison contained in earthy accumulations
than the hard drying or the low grade varnish.</p>

<p>Accumulations of mud allowed to dry upon a freshly varnished surface
spot the varnish through the action of the suction or capillary attraction of
the dry mud extracting the oil from the varnish. Again, the spotting may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
be due to actual saponification, by the alkaline mud, not only of the oil, but
of the gum constituent of the varnish as well.</p>

<p>City mud strongly charged with ammonia, and the mud of lime districts,
is notoriously destructive to varnish lustre. While it rarely happens that
any sort of treatment short of rubbing off the surface and re-varnishing
proves satisfactory, the trouble may now and then be effaced, temporarily, at
least, by first rubbing the spots with a rag moistened with equal parts of
linseed oil, turpentine, and alcohol, and then immediately polishing with a
soft piece of blotting paper.</p>

<p>Soapy or dirty water spotting, which may be distinguished by the
usually correct circle outline, is difficult, if not impossible, of effacement,
especially if allowed to long remain upon the surface, as the potash and acid
nature of the water takes a ready and sharp hold of the varnish. A prompt
washing off with clean soft water will sometimes prove a cure. This failing,
rubbing off and re-varnishing must be resorted to.</p>

<p>The gases generated by an ordinary coal stove or blacksmith's forge, if
permitted for long to attack a varnish surface, will effect a particularly
grievous type of spotting. This will manifest itself in the form of dull,
lustreless spots richly suffused with a film of greasiness. The rubbing down
and re-varnishing is the only reliable and sure cure for this depravity.
Spotting caused by unusual or disturbing currents of air beating with
moderate or fierce intensity upon a sensitive surface is met with in the shape
and appearance of dull, indistinctly defined spots, irregular in form, sometimes
elongated, frequently of conoidical outline. The first indications of
this variety of spotting should be met with a prompt washing off with clean
water and a careful drying up under the chamois skin.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The chief and essential purpose of striping is to impart a beautifying
effect to the surface upon which it is used. To accomplish this
purpose it must be so perfectly and artistically executed that the
colors employed in painting the surface are made to reflect their most
charming harmonies and contrasts, while the outlines of the surface itself
are cast into more graceful relief. The art of striping, when it achieves this
result, may be said to have successfully performed its office; and the expert
exponent of this art, it need scarcely be added, is accounted an important
member of every well-regulated paint shop family.</p>

<p>To be a really skilled striper, the workman needs to be the possessor of
a steady hand, or, in the words of another, of "hand magic," of an accurate
eye, and plenty of color sense. In point of fact, it is highly necessary that
the striper should be a good colorist; one, in short, who is thoroughly
conversant with the rules of color harmony and contrast.</p>

<p>The first law with which the novice or learner of the art of striping or
ornamenting is confronted is that of color and form. This he must study
patiently and persistently, the while practicing with the pencil in order that
the purely mechanical part of the art be well mastered. Grace, freedom,
sure-handedness, are indispensable factors, as applied to the mechanical
features of striping and ornamenting, and these can be attained only through
the agency of diligent practice, combined with the help of an eye educated
to act quickly and accurately. There can be no arbitrary rules laid down
to govern the art of striping in so far as it has reference to style. Style is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but the fleeting fancy of "the passing show," and while it is here today it
may be gone tomorrow. Hence, the fashion in striping is indefinite and
sufficiently elastic to adapt itself to local requirements without departing far
from what may chance to be at the time generally accepted as the prevailing
style. For, after all, the striping must be subordinate to form, color, and
surface, and its lavish or meagre employment, in plain or fancy design, is
controlled very largely thereby.</p>

<h3>THE STRIPER'S OUTFIT.</h3>

<p>The pencil equipment is properly a matter of the first concern to the
striper. The last decade has witnessed the retirement, in large part at least,
of the round pencils, save when stripes are to be done in sizes exceeding
<span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> in. The vividly sensational name of "dagger" or "sword pencil" has
been applied to the pencil which has taken the place of the round liner.
Practically all vehicle stripers use these pencils at present. A single pencil,
if necessary, can be made to draw a various assortment of lines, running
from the hair line to the
round line, or even heavier.
But, all things considered,
the writer deems it best to
have a pencil made to draw
a certain line and no other. This necessitates the ownership of a larger
equipment of pencils, but it also provides for uniformly good work more
easily accomplished than can be expected when one pencil is made to do
duty in drawing the variously sized lines called for in the average carriage
and wagon shop. In <a href="#Fig_8_01">Fig. 1</a>, accompanying this chapter, is shown a fine line
sword pencil. This draws a hair line when filled properly, and cannot be
made to exceed a fine line and do effective work. <a href="#Fig_8_02">Fig. 2</a> is a medium fine
line pencil, and <a href="#Fig_8_03">Fig. 3</a> represents a pencil with which a fine line or a round
line, or any line varying between these two, may be drawn. The striper
should be provided with at least four different sizes of pencils. To make
the sword pencil, proceed as follows: Take the desired portion of hair from a
large camel's-hair pencil of selected quality, and draw to the proper bevel
from one side of the flat portion of the hair. Then, taking the hair carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in the left hand, with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand work a bit
of trimmer's paste into the end that is inserted into the handle. Narrow
strips of paper, say <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> in. in width, and of the full length of the hair, are
cut and spread with a thin glazing of the paste, and on these prepared strips,
about the center of
them, lay the hair,
keeping it perfectly
straight. Next, fold
the uncovered portions
of the paper
over the hair. The
day following, or at
any time in the future,
the superfluous
hair and paper may
be trimmed from the
embryo pencil and a
handle attached. A
straight-grained piece
of pine affords a good
handle. Split in center
of handle, insert
the hair in the split,
wrap tightly with
stout linen thread, and
the pencil is ready for
use. In the making
of the sword pencil
there is often a superfluity
of short hairs,
of which it is desirable
to be well rid. To
remove them, take
the hair before it is
greased, and with the
end that is to be
bound with the thread
held between the
thumb and forefinger
of the left hand, pull the long hairs over to the right, thus exposing the
short and useless hairs and affording an easy removal of them. This process
of weeding out the naturally short hair develops the pencil of one length of
stock excepting, of course, the desired taper of the tool. While many
supply houses now furnish sword pencils of all sizes and lengths, the first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
stripers, the chevaliers of the art, prefer to make their own pencils, and
the writer heartily coincides with that preference, the shop-made pencil
usually having a poise and balance not possessed by the store-purchased
article. To those of my readers who accept the dictum that there is no
royal road to the art of striping; that
the severe schooling in the busy arena
of every-day practice is the culture
that graduates the talented striper, I
would say, learn to make your pencils.
Your first attempt, or your second,
and perhaps even your third, may not
result successfully, but patience and a
capacity for taking infinite pains will
eventually, if not shortly, win. It is
best to make pencils in lots of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> doz.
Two or three out of the lot, even after
one becomes tolerably proficient in
pencil making, may prove defective.
The method of making the sword
pencil, as above advised, has the
advantage of being easily and quickly
acquired, and is therefore recommended
to the learner as a feasible one to
adopt. With these sword, or dagger,
pencils many of the ornamental striping
designs which will accompany this
and later chapters may be executed,
the extreme point of the pencil being
used in describing all curves and fancy
circles.</p>

<p>To make a round fine line pencil
suited to the execution of corner pieces
and cut up striping generally, take a
camel's-hair round pencil of large size,
from which extract the desired quantity
of hair. Then cut a small piece
of cedar down to about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> in. diameter
at one end and considerably smaller at
the other. In the smaller end insert a
pin until it holds firmly. Then, say,
<span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> in. from the wood, clip the pin off.
Now shave the stick off until it tapers
perfectly down to the pin. Next take
the desired quantity of hair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
dipping one end of the brush into shellac, lay
aside for a few minutes to permit the shellac
to harden. Then insert the pin and tapered
point of the wood until the clear working
length of the pencil measures at least <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> in.
from point of pin. Begin at the lower end of
the hair and wind with strong thread up to
within <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> in. from point of pin. The pin acts
in the capacity of a stiffener to the pencil.</p>

<p>The durability and poise and elasticity of
striping and lettering
pencils
depend very
greatly upon the
manner of caring
for them. The
striper should
provide himself
with a dust-proof
metal box in
which to store
his pencil equipment.
See that it is furnished with lock and
key. The local tinsmith will, for a small consideration,
outfit such a box with a tin tray
upon which the pencils may be carefully
arranged. A striping or lettering pencil
should be immediately washed out in turps
upon the conclusion of the work in hand.
Care may well be invoked in washing, to the
end that all pigment accumulations are removed
from the heel of the pencil. Wipe the
pencil dry in soft cotton or flannel cloths and
then grease thoroughly, pressing the grease
carefully into the heel of the tool. A good
grease for preserving pencils in winter is pure
lard; in summer, lard and mutton tallow, equal
parts. The writer personally vouches for the
excellence of a mixture composed of mutton
tallow, 3 parts; sweet oil, 1 part. This serves
as a good all-round pencil grease, suited to all
extremes of temperature, and one the painter
will find useful in keeping his pencils in good
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3>MIXING STRIPING COLORS.</h3>

<p>This comprises a difficult and skilled feature
of the art of striping. Colors which are
worked and controlled easily and dry reliably,
are important aids to good striping.
Therefore, in order to insure speed, shapely
lines, and satisfactory color effects, the striper
will find it greatly to his advantage to closely
and intelligently study the composition of
pigments. Some colors have the defect of
being "short." In other words, they do not
naturally work freely from the point of the
pencil, blotching and flowing out in patches.
It is not within the province of the painter to
cure this ailment, but it is possible for him to
remedy it somewhat. And how? By abstaining
from the use of oil altogether, and depending
solely upon a mixture of japan, varnish,
and turpentine, the proportions of these
liquids being governed by the liquids in which
the colors were ground. Oil colors in carriage
painting are restricted to a narrow margin of
use. This specially applies to colors employed
in striping, as, save in purely lead colors, the
oil has a bad habit of working to the surface of
the pigment. When, to meet a certain requirement
or emergency, it is found necessary
to use oil in the striping color, it is advisable
to also add a few drops of quick rubbing
varnish as a means of holding the oil in place.
White, black, and some of the yellows are
usually found under the head of short colors.
Flake and cremnitz white are invariably
designated as short colors. If such colors are
to be used for fine lining, mix with a little
rubbing varnish and tint the white slightly
with drop black. This furnishes a fairly free
working white which shows no laps.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 178px;">
<img src="images/i_b_069.jpg" width="178" height="650" alt="Example Striping Design" />
</div>

<p>Black may best be described as a riotous,
wild-running color, strongly in need of a
sturdy steadying liquid. In thinning black to
a working consistency, add, say <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> rubbing varnish. Balanced with this
proportion of rubbing varnish, a finely-ground tube black usually works
handsomely. The writer would advise mixing all striping colors to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
right consistency in the cups,
instead of using them on the
palette in a thick paste and
thinning down under the pencil
as fast as used. Colors furnished
with the right ingredients, properly
proportioned, the whole being
thoroughly united and incorporated,
constitute a fine working
basis for effective striping.</p>

</div>


<h3>NAMES OF STRIPES.</h3>

<p>In all the foremost carriage
and wagon centres the various
styles of striping are designated
by specific names. This makes
it an easy matter to give an
order and have it accurately executed without confusion or unnecessary
delay. Appended will be found the principal lines and stripes generally
employed, the medium lines and stripes only being omitted. As, for instance
medium fine line, medium heavy round line, and medium stripe; these being
deemed irrelevant to the illustration in hand. The first, or hair, line is the
finest line used, the fine line coming next, the line thus gradually increasing
in size until it reaches the broad stripe. What is known as the medium fine
line is simply the fine line broadened to the extent of about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> increase in
size. The medium heavy
round line is the round
line with the width of
hair line added to it,
while the medium stripe
is the narrow stripe increased
by the addition
of a fine line width. A
pencil tracing exceeding
<span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> in. is termed a stripe;
less than <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> in., a line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_b_070b.jpg" width="400" height="391" alt="Example Striping Design" />
</div>

<p>As herewith shown
the simple lines and
stripes are seven in
number, and the combination
lines and stripes
are presented in eight
examples. In the cut
of the divided stripe,
distance fine line, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
distance line is drawn nearer to the stripe than
it is customary to allow. While there is no
arbitrary rule to govern the spacing of the
distance line from the stripe, it is usually
drawn not less than <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> in. from center line or
stripe. Oftentimes, too, it is placed at a distance
of scant <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> in., as here shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/i_b_071.jpg" width="176" height="650" alt="Example Striping Design" />
</div>

<p>The accompanying striping designs adapted
to traps, drags, stanhopes, concords, and
pleasure vehicles generally (used also on
business vehicles) consist of corner and center
pieces. Their representation may suggest
extensions or changes, through the medium
of which a wide variety of designs may be
evolved. To specify the colors in which each
design is best illuminated would exceed the
limits accorded this chapter.</p>

<p>The color of the panel determines the color
of the design, or should. A pleasing contrast
to the body color should be sought, and in
this achievement the workman's taste and art
sense must be exercised in lieu of printed
directions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/i_b_072.jpg" width="446" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CORNER DESIGNS.</div>
</div>

<p>The panel designs, if placed on any dark
surface, may be placed in white and trimmed
in green, blue, vermilion, etc.; or they may be
placed in carmine and tricked out in any of
the many neatly contrasting colors. The
finest carmine effects are obtained by glazing
orange or chrome yellow with carmine.
Against the fashionable blue surfaces many of
these designs present fetching effects if drawn
in gold, white, or king's yellow. Against
yellow grounds they may be effectively shown
in two or three shades of red. These suggestions
apply also, in the main, to the corner
pieces. The three last designs on <a id="no_page_184">page 184</a> may be laid in gold, shaded with asphaltum,
high lighted with light yellow. The fine
lines can be done in any harmonizing color.
Some of the small solid parts of these designs
can be glazed with carmine and verdigris.
Some of the designs may be executed in
orange, glazed with carmine and high lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with chrome yellow. Or the broad portions may be done in some solid
color and the fine lines in a slightly different shade of the same color. On
blue panels the simple fine line pieces may be done with lining bronze glazed
with ultramarine blue; or on green panels use chrome yellow and glaze with
carmine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/i_b_073.jpg" width="540" height="650" alt="Example Corner Design" />
</div>

<p>In fact, there is an infinite variety of colors to be used in the development
of the designs here presented, and the still other designs which it is
hoped they may suggest, the controlling factor in the selection of colors
being simply and at all times the color of the surface upon which the design
is to be used. In connection with this must exist the law of harmony and
contrast, without which any selected color scheme will prove ineffective.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Scroll painting is a feature of the trade deserving of more than a
passing notice; and while it has been permitted to languish in a state
of disuse for a decade or more, as compared to its former popularity,
there are evidences abroad which point directly to the generous employment
of the art of scrolling in wagon painting ere long.</p>

<p>Perhaps we shall never again observe the return of the fine old Roman
scroll, bold and imperial, once so common, but a modification of this noblest
Roman of them all, or, rather, a combination of this form of scroll and some
other forms requiring less space for attractive display, may be expected.
Indeed, the modification is already domiciled in the esteem of business
vehicle users, being commonly known under the title of composite scroll.</p>

<p>The full Roman scroll, defined
as an imitation of carved
work in relief, which Raphael
and other great masters have
so magnificently executed, is
of large and shapely proportions,
and with its fine sweeps,
graceful curves, beautiful examples of leafing, and endless variety of twists
and turns, cannot be confined to a restricted space. It is pre-eminently a scroll
of stately style, and amid dwarfish surroundings or when reduced to less
than its natural size, its identity is lost and its character as one of the earliest
forms of ornamentation, completely destroyed. Hence the modification
above referred to.</p>

<p>In learning the art of scrolling, as in learning the art of striping, it is
distinctly fortunate to remember that there is no royal road&mdash;no mystic
method by which one can master the art under the soothing influence of a
mid-summer night's dream. The acquirement of the art, as the past masters
of the school of ornamental painting understood and practiced it, is the
result of patient, arduous practice. For this purpose, a good-sized blackboard
is in every way the most desirable surface upon which to work. The
beginner should under no circumstances confine his efforts to learn scrolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to a pad of paper and a lead pencil.
As an eminent instructor of
the art once declared: "Work
with a lead pencil on a 2×4
paper, and the chances are that
your scrolls will be of the 2×4
order." Working upon the
blackboard with a chalk crayon
gives the learner a freedom of
reach and a valiant command of
the pencil attained in no other
way. The easy, free-hand work,
although it may be lacking in
certain highly desirable features
of gracefulness, compels the
favorable attention of the critic
to an extent of which the copy
plate design, mathematically precise in general execution, may fall
lamentably short. There is a sort of an indefinable naturalness about the
original, free-hand scroll quite foreign to the ornament drawn to rule and
square measurements. It possesses a quality that elicits admiration, just as
madam's tea gown,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"That floats away where it properly may,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And clings where it ought to cling,"</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>is looked upon as a dainty creation, wondrous fair to see.</p>

<div id="Fig_9_04" class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_079a.jpg" width="300" height="303" alt="Scrolling Example" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The blackboard and chalk crayon exercise is valuable in imparting to
the learner a natural and unstudied twist of the wrist, together with a whole
arm movement that most assuredly must be at the command of the scroll
workman. Only by such exercise can the quick, artistic hand be acquired
along with an eye trained to correct
proportions.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Hogarth's line of beauty can be
more expeditiously mastered under
the stimulus of blackboard practice
than is possible through the aid of
most other mediums. Make the
figures big and reaching, in sweeps
backward and forward, up, down,
and in a variety of outlines. This
practice will be hard and irksome
at first, and, unless one is naturally
gifted in this particular line of
work, the results accomplished may
appear crude and awkward even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
after weeks of patiently applied
toil. But in the realms of art
few things to speak in the noble
lingo of the Bowery, are "dead
easy." Therefore, blackboard
work should be studiously adhered
to, the work of eminent
exponents of ornamental painting
studied, as the mariner studies
the ocean chart, and advantage
taken of all the other aids promotive
of a rare degree of skill.
The scroll painter able to discard
pounce pattern and tape line
measurements is licensed to
impart a charm and novelty, a
grace and variety, to his work, not effected otherwise. The spiral may be
termed the basis of scroll work. Intersecting the spiral are the leaves and
stems, which, shaded, lighted, and high-lighted, give form and color to the
relief scroll.</p>

<p>The learner, having become sufficiently proficient to outline fairly good
scrolls with the crayon, should procure some large sheets of paper&mdash;manilla
paper will do&mdash;and paint them in some dark color and then proceed to draw
the scrolls with the pencil.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the matter of pencils, different kinds and sizes will be needed. For
laying on the scroll, a black sable hair pencil, the hair set in metal, running
in size from No. 4 to No. 8, according to the size of the scroll, and <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> inches
long, is an effective and pleasingly durable
tool. For shading purposes a shorter and
softer hair pencil is best; say a camel's-hair
pencil <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch in length. However, a variety
of pencils, both sable and camel's-hair, and of
the various sizes, will be found essential in
doing the large and small ornaments which
the accompanying examples may suggest.
Necessary adjuncts to the pencil equipment
are, the palette, palette cups, and mahl-stick.
An oval palette, made thin and smooth, of
mahogany, walnut, or even ash, polished
nicely on a shellac base, has for long been
popular, and in point of excellence remains
unexcelled. Make the mahl-stick of cedar
preferably; work it out round and smooth and
tip it with a small ball of cotton enclosed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
patch of chamois skin. Taking the
accompanying illustrated section of
a Roman scroll (see <a href="#Fig_9_01">Fig. 1</a>) as a
working draft, begin by allowing
the point of the pencil to touch the
surface and then with a confident,
easy sweep twist the pencil around so
as to form, say, the first spiral or
volute. Next do the stems and offshoots
attached to this volute. Practice
to do each spiral, and the stems
putting out therefrom, with a single,
and at most two, strokes of the pencil.
The first principle of fine scrolling
consists in getting easy, graceful
sweeps, suggestive, perhaps, I may
be allowed to say, of the poetry of
pencil motion. The tracery of a stilted, cramped pencil sweep is fatal to the
balance and grace of a scroll. In practice the student will probably choose
gold bronze as the most desirable substitute for gold leaf in working out his
gold-finished scroll. The figure, without its shading, affords a flat scroll of
fantastic contour, as a draft of <a href="#Fig_9_01">Fig. 1</a>, devoid of the shades, will quickly
prove.</p>

<div class="center">
<div id="Fig_9_10" class="figcenter inlineblock" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/i_b_082b.jpg" width="325" height="324" alt="Scrolling Example" />
</div>
</div>

<p>The shading of the scroll must be done in the same free, off-hand style
that must necessarily mark the evolution of the general figure of the ornament.
If, as above intimated, the scroll is done in imitation of or in the
real gold leaf, the shading is best done with asphaltum, this pigment offering
the only true shadow, authorities
contend, of gold. Mix the
asphaltum with good coach
japan and turpentine, half and
half. Reference to <a href="#Fig_9_01">Fig. 1</a>, and
to the other accompanying illustrations,
will indicate more accurately
than printed directions the
parts of a scroll requiring shades.
The inadequacy of written instructions
teaching the particular
portions of the ornament to be
high-lighted must be apparent to
the reader. Broadly speaking,
where the strongest light strikes
there high lights should be.
For a really practical insight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
this phase of the work the student should
study examples of finished scrolls done in
the highest style of the art. The gold
scroll shaded with asphaltum invites high-lighting
with white or cream color.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_083a.jpg" width="250" height="266" alt="Scrolling Example" />

<p>In the execution of relief scrolls it is
needful to observe:</p>

<p>1.&mdash;All ornaments must have a reason&mdash;a
useful thing done in a graceful way.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Every line should be boldly, clearly,
and elegantly drawn.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Harmony of design, balance of proportions,
sympathetic formation of the
various parts, demand vigilant maintenance.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Originality of design, with every part having an intimate relationship,
an indivisible connection with every other part, is indispensable.</p>

<p>In the execution of a relief scroll, or any style of scroll for that matter,
it is a factor of the first importance that the surface be smooth and thoroughly
dry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_b_083b.jpg" width="400" height="401" alt="Scrolling Example" />
</div>

<p>A great deal of business vehicle scrolling is necessarily done upon the
color-and-varnish coat or upon clear rubbing varnish. To prevent the gold
leaf (in case gold is used) from adhering to the varnish coat, various
expedients have been resorted to, among which the whiting pounce figures
as the most effective and the easiest applied. Other recipes include rubbing
the surface with a thin solution of starch and water, or glazing it with the
white of an egg, or washing
it with whiting and
water, or applying a thin
film of potato starch upon
it. Good gilding size is
very essential in the art
of scrolling. The light
and easy whirls of the
pencil cannot be done
with a size unsuited for
the purpose. Moreover,
shop requirements have
to be met, and they may
impose a limit of two
hours in which the size
must dry today, and tomorrow
that limit may
be extended to four
hours or even longer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
perhaps&mdash;although in these days of
ocean racers and Black Diamond
flyers this may be a remote possibility&mdash;the
size will be expected to
hold over night, after its application,
before being gilded.</p>

<p>Quick size.&mdash;Gold size japan, 5
parts; fat oil, 1 part. With a dash
of japan ground chrome yellow, this
size will dry to safely leaf over in
<span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> hour.</p>

<p>Medium quick size.&mdash;Gold size
japan, 4 parts; fat oil, 2 parts.</p>

<p>Four-hour size.&mdash;Gold size japan
and fat oil, in proportions of <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>
japan to <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> oil.</p>

<p>Over-night size.&mdash;Fat oil with a
few drops of gold size japan added.</p>

<p>The slow drying size works
better and affords a more satisfactory
job of gilding than does the
quicker mixture, the gold invariably
taking a fine burnish over the slow,
fat oil size.</p>

<p>The best obtainable fat oil is
made by confining boiled linseed oil
in a bottle and exposing for a long
time to the sun.</p>

<p>To paint relief scrolls in colors is,
in some respects, more difficult than
doing them in gold or aluminum
leaf, and while the radiant combinations
of pigments furnish striking
effects, there is lacking in the
painted scroll a richness, an
elegance, an aristocratic display,
that constitute distinctive attributes
of the gilded scroll. The color of
the surface upon which the scroll is to be painted should, of course, govern
the color in which the scroll is to be laid. For example: If the ground be
a light canary color, first fill the outlines of the scroll with a pale shade of
brown. Then deepen the brown fully three shades, and begin the shading
of the scroll, blending the deeper color into the lighter so that a gradual
melting away from dark to light is the result. Next deepen the brown a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
shade or two and place the darkest
shades, blending them carefully into the
lighter ones, but taking care not to
extend the blending into the parts
previously blended. Next take a little
black and run a rather fine line of the
color as a shadow to the scroll, the
shadow usually being placed to the
right of the scroll and at the bottom.
This shadow line, to be properly developed,
should increase and diminish as
the curves and twists are defined. A
thin, fine glaze of asphaltum is then
placed inside the black to shade and
modulate it. Some lights of medium
chrome yellow are next thrown in, and
the high lights following are but a shade
or two removed from white. To lend
piquancy and a bit of warmth to the
scroll, a few touches of vermilion, flicking
the spirals here and there but invariably
well removed from the lower edge
of the pattern, are added. Instructions,
however carefully they may be worded,
are of but comparatively meagre helpfulness
to the novice in painting scrolls in
colors. Correctly colored illustrations of
scrolls done by such masters as Weber,
Kuenzel and Redmond, should be diligently
studied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/i_b_086.jpg" width="246" height="650" alt="Scrolling Example" />
</div>

<p>The harmony of colors is the controlling
factor in the art scheme of a color-wrought
scroll. Once perfectly familiar
with this, the ambitious student should
encounter no insurmountable hindrances
to success as a scroll worker in colors. Referring to the relief scrolls which
illustrate the text of this chapter, we would call attention to <a href="#Fig_9_01">Fig. 1</a>. If this
be executed in gold it may, as previously suggested, be shaded with
asphaltum, or asphaltum and yellow lake can be used, and the high lights
done in a light tone of Naples yellow. Perhaps the workman may wish to
impart to the deepest shading a look of remoteness. This can be done by
giving the dark shades a thin wash of some transparent glazing color, as,
say, carmine, purple, and crimson lake, or ultramarine blue of the different
shades. In <a href="#Fig_9_02">Fig. 2</a> we have a panel design composed in small part of the original
Roman scroll and in large part of the more modern style. Lay this scroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in gold, and then apply a coat of clear rubbing
varnish over the ornament before shading, high-lighting,
etc. A scroll of this pattern, cast in
somewhat delicate outlines, must be very
carefully shaded, and if the shading be done
over the rubbing varnish, the tendency to
cloud and blur will be overcome. In shading,
care should be taken to preserve the form and
outlines of the design, and this can best be
done by making the shade color decidedly
semi-transparent. To high-light this scroll,
cream, orange, canary chrome, or pure white
may be used to advantage. An ornament of this
style looks very catchy and handsome done in
aluminum leaf. It is strikingly neat on almost
any dark ground, with the single exception,
perhaps, of black; and it is especially pleasing
against the numerous yellows so popular
nowadays. Used on the pale yellow grounds,
however, it is seen to the best advantage with
portions of the design glazed with a wash of
verdigris, ultramarine blue, or carmine. The
fine line is then done in orange or Tuscan red.
<a href="#Fig_9_03">Fig. 3</a> is a rather showy design, of easy form,
having for a small space none of the heavy
appearance of the Roman scroll. This scroll
is intended for the panel of a business wagon.
If done in gold, the directions for its execution
have already been advanced. The broad line
striping environing the scroll gives an admirable
effect if done in aluminum. The distance
fine line can be drawn in the high-lighting
color used on the scroll, or it affords an illuminating
effect done in orange and glazed with
carmine. The size of the panel should govern
the size of the broad stripe here shown. It
may run from <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> inch to <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> inch. <a href="#Fig_9_04">Fig. 4</a>
illustrates a corner ornament for a large business
vehicle or omnibus panel. It can be laid
in gold and shaded and lighted as per directions
above. If upon a deep yellow, orange,
or buff ground, it can be done to the charm of
a rich effect by casting it in aluminum, shading
with gold, and picking out with dainty flicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of black. <a href="#Fig_9_05">Fig. 5</a> looks effective on the ends of small panels. On yellow or
creamy grounds the fine lines may be drawn in orange glazed with carmine,
and the ornaments in aluminum. Shade with burnt umber and burnt sienna,
and the shade side of the shading splash lightly with deep blue and the
high-light borders with light blue. On dark grounds the fine lines may be
done in orange, carmine, blue, aluminum, etc., and the relief ornaments in
gold. <a href="#Fig_9_06">Figs. 6 and 7</a>, ornaments for panel ends, and <a href="#Fig_9_08">8</a> and <a href="#Fig_9_09">9</a>, corner ornaments,
all light up a surface radiantly placed in gold or aluminum, or they
render a pleasing effect done in colors. Ornaments of the order of Figs. <a href="#Fig_9_06">7</a>,
<a href="#Fig_9_08">8</a>, and <a href="#Fig_9_09">9</a> display a dashing appearance done in three or four shades of green
against pure white, gold color, light sulphur yellow, Naples yellow, or
canary yellow grounds, black shadings being used to touch off the correct
effect. Such ornaments, to be sure, when painted in colors should properly
be made to respond closely to the laws of harmony and contrast. Too glaring
colors or tints used upon goodly sized surfaces are violently detrimental to
artistic decorative effects. <a href="#Fig_9_10">Fig. 10</a> is chiefly of the flat ornament style, the
center shell only being thrown in relief. This corner piece is done in gold
with the shell shaded and lighted, or, as is frequently the case, the shell may
be done in aluminum, and washed out with the proper relief colors.</p>

<h3>FLAT SCROLLS.</h3>

<p>The flat scroll is distinguished from the relief scroll in that it is lacking
in all forms of relief ornamentation. The flat scroll is vastly more simple in
its working out; hence many workmen essay the flat scroll who under no
circumstances would attempt to execute a relief design. The flat scroll is
almost invariably first placed upon the surface through the medium of the
pounce pattern, and it is then filled in. The design of the flat scroll once
laid out on paper, the painter used to manipulating a lettering or striping
pencil can readily fill in the outlines. The designing of the flat scroll can best
be done upon manilla paper, the tracings being executed with a lead pencil.
Then lay the paper over a double thickness of, say, railway car plush and pick
out the lines with a small awl. On wagon work the flat scroll put on by
means of stencils is not often seen. In the railway car paint shop the flat
scroll is usually stenciled on.</p>

<p>Some decidedly captivating examples of flat scroll work are to be observed
upon many business vehicles in the larger towns and cities. Many of these
scrolls are laid in plain gold or aluminum, in a variety of colors, as well as
in colors and gold, and very often aluminum. Frequently the heaviest
parts, leaves, etc., are edged with some richly adorning color, and quite as
often the veining of the leaves is traced into prominence. The accompanying
eight illustrations of flat scrolls, corner, end, and center panel patterns, will,
it is hoped, afford at least a helpful working idea of the possibilities of the
flat scroll style of vehicle ornamentation.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Of late years the art of sign writing, or, in the speech of the shop,
lettering, has come to be so generally regarded as particularly
distinct and apart from the other branches of painting, having a
literature rich and diversified in its resources, that, at first thought, it would
seem perfectly feasible and proper to omit from these chapters any attempt to
deal with the subject. Nevertheless, upon further consideration the writer
has preferred to accept the art, for the present at least, as an indivisible part
of the carriage and wagon painter's shop practice; and while a thorough
exposition of modern sign writing would necessarily trespass immoderately
upon the space allotted to the numerous and vitally essential phases of
carriage and wagon painting, and cannot, therefore, be entered into, to
ignore the branch altogether might fairly be branded as too palpable an
oversight to merit excuse. Happily, however, the art of sign writing has
been so extensively treated upon in numerous books devoted specially to the
subject, and in hundreds of exhaustive magazine articles, that it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
necessary in this chapter to touch only upon the salient features of the work
as they directly concern and apply to the interests of the carriage and wagon
painter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_089.jpg" width="600" height="304" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Roman Alphabet.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Not later than fifteen years ago the standard styles of the wagon letterer
consisted of about five alphabets. The modern sign writer and letterer,
encouraged and directed by the forces of recent business development, has to
a large extent demolished this standard, substituting therefor what is generally
accepted as up-to-date sign writing&mdash;a style that readily admits of the
employment of whatever form or style of letter will best and most vividly
advertise the business it is intended to herald. Complaints have been
sounded in widely read publications to the effect that "it was at one time the
wagon letterer's good fortune to possess an occupation and a name above
that of the sign writer." "His work," we are told, "could be quickly
distinguished from the ordinary letterer or sign painter by its boldness and
the care given to details. These days have gone by, and we find the well-known
and approved style of the wagon letterer prostituted to the idiosyncrasies
of house and sign painters."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_090.jpg" width="600" height="230" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Roman Numerals.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Such complaints, we are free to say, are in the main exaggerated. The
wagon letterer has not been, nor is he in any present danger of being,
Othello-like, without an occupation. Moreover, despite the adoption by the
wagon letterers of those styles which most completely respond to the dictates
of modern business, there still remain certain marked characteristics of the
vehicle letterer's work which distinguish it from the efforts of the most
finished sign writer. Not that the work of the wagon letterer differs
conspicuously from that of the expert general sign writer&mdash;the field of up-to-date
sign work having merged the two branches into close relationship&mdash;but
the difference is manifest, as before said, in characteristics most plainly
unmistakable. Naturally, this variation should occur.</p>

<p>A sign that would appear legible and clean cut upon a building might,
if transferred to the panel of a more or less rapidly moving vehicle, prove
unreadable and hopelessly indistinct. A sign attached to a building or other
stationary object admits of study from the various points of the compass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
from near by or afar off. It is not a fleeting show as in case of the vehicle
sign, subject to laws of propulsion which vary to meet existing business
exigencies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_091.jpg" width="600" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Modified Block Alphabet.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Perspective effects, heights, widths, thickness of lines, etc., because of
the usually generous sweep of space at command, as secured by the sign
writer, do not come within the scope of the wagon letterer's activity, save in
rare instances. Ordinarily wagon spaces to be lettered are of dwarfed
dimensions and quite commonly cast in irregular outlines. In wagon
lettering, whenever possible, the extended letter frequently has the preference.
An able and widely observant critic says "it might almost be said
that the customary speed of a vehicle can be measured by the degree of
elongation which the letterer gives to his work, the lightning express car
representing the ultimatum in one direction, while the mammoth furniture
van, with its high art panels, is characteristic of the other." The chief
distinguishing feature of wagon lettering, as contrasted with the average
results of sign writing, is found in the wider variety of elegant color effects
to be remarked of the first named. The wagon letterer essays glazing with
many of the beautiful transparent pigments, and in this wise brings forth
charming combinations in color seldom attempted by the sign writer.</p>

<p>The wagon letterer's work is done, as a rule, with quick drying colors or
size, and almost invariably is varnished over. Surface smoothness is therefore
with him a matter of the first importance. The art of the wagon letterer
is composed of many difficulties, each of which must be surmounted ere the
learner can hope to stand among the select few and quaff the foam from the
beaker of success.</p>

<p>However, let me say that a thorough mastery of the art is worth all the
toil, patient study, diligent practice, and applied energy the aspirant may
choose to expend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>To achieve proficiency in this branch of painting, it is advisable to
practice outlining letters with a chalk crayon, or, preferably, pipe clay on a
goodly sized blackboard. All lines, straight or curved, should be drawn in
free hand, and the practice ought, properly, to be regularly continued until
the workman acquires a reliable degree of precision. Ease, freedom, and a
masterly command of the hand, coupled with a fairly unerring accuracy of
the eye, are justly indispensable accomplishments in sign writing or wagon
lettering. Absence of mechanical aids will render free hand and eye work
more assured. Many admittedly first-class sign writers practice marking
out with rule, compass, and line every letter which they produce, insisting
upon mechanical accuracy in "laying out" as the only correct means of
developing style. Such workmen, unfortunately, were probably indifferent,
in apprenticeship days, to the advantages to be derived from free hand
drawing, and being strangers to them they find themselves greatly handicapped
thereby.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Modified Block Numerals.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The free-hand and rule-rivalling-eye mechanic goes to his space to be
lettered and after a swift, accurate study of the limitations and contour of
that space, as a basis for the letter construction, including style, height,
thickness, etc., he snaps the necessary top and bottom lines and proceeds to
rapidly, but lightly, sketch out his letters. Fairly marvelous examples of
this manner of mechanics are to be encountered in sign and wagon establishments.
Such men are rarely ever in search of a job. The job is mostly in
sharp search of them.</p>

<p>Such skill and facility in execution of lay outs is not gained in a day.
An eminent vehicle letterer once told the writer that he "was glad to have
acquired the 'knack' of accurate free hand and eye work after <em>years</em> of
practice." At present there are boundless fields of originality awaiting the
sign writer and vehicle letterer. Imitation of the styles of expert letterers
may with the beginner lead up to nobler examples of the art&mdash;for has not
the sage whispered that genius knows only the right of conquest?&mdash;but to
the apprentice, fired with the sacred spark of ambition, copying will not long
suffice.</p>

<p>The acknowledged best examples of sign writing and wagon lettering
should serve as the beginner's model, rather than the work of any single
practitioner of the art. The fact that the work of every letterer has a certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
positive individuality of style furnishes the best possible reason why the
learner should strive to avoid copying continuously the various alphabets of
any individual expert to the exclusion of all others.</p>


<h3>LAYING OUT, SPACING, OUTLINING, AND BALANCING</h3>

<p>of a job of wagon lettering are factors of chief concern. The artistic and
really beautiful example of lettering is brought forth only when praiseworthy
skill is exercised in executing the operations named. Individuality of workmanship
is based upon the style of laying out. A workman practiced in
handling a lettering or striping pencil can very soon master the difficulties
of painting a letter after it is outlined. The job accurately and artistically
laid out, even if lettered in a manner not strictly up to the standard, will far
more effectively fulfill its mission as a work of art than will the one properly
penciled but improperly designed. The key, then, to fine wagon lettering
may be embraced in the work of laying out. To present rules by which the
workman may at all times and closely abide in preparing a contemplated
design for letter painting would be impracticable because the laying out,
with its attendant features, must conform to the size, form, and general
condition of the surface. In laying out, the best exponents of the art are
agreed that it is advisable to employ as few lines as possible. The fewer
lines, the more grace, freedom, and easy poise of the letters. At the beginning
of his career the letterer will probably need the aid of four lines, two
for the top limbs and two for the bottom limbs of the letters. As he gains in
skill and experience the two inside lines may be dispensed with. Then with
the ever present dividers in hand the space so lined out may be "touched off"
until the necessary divisions to accommodate the letters desired in the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
are spaced. Generally speaking, all letters, except W, M, J, and I, have
equal spaces, one square, for example. M and W require a bit more space,
I and J a bit less. There is to be remarked a considerable variation in the
space between letters, some of the letters being full in form and some open.
In the use of L, F, J, A, V, W, T, Y, only half the space given to the
other letters is allowable, and in the placing of V and L less than half is
permissible, one letter being advanced well into the space allowed the other.
The letter I is in some respects a difficult letter to space correctly. When it
chances to be cast between two letters occupying full squares each it will
require more than the usual space, otherwise, being a needle-like letter, it
will be elbowed out of easy location.</p>

</div>

<p>The vehicle letterer, daily practicing his art, will frequently find himself
confronted with words or combinations of words to which rules of spacing,
however carefully they may be laid down, do not apply. In such cases hard
and fast rules of spacing cannot be successfully observed. Spacing to suit
individual requirements must then obtain. Here a letter may be moved
from its nearest neighbor a little more than its ordinarily allotted space
would permit; there a letter is placed closer to its neighbor than the rules
usually allow. The position of several letters may be disturbed in order
that the word or words may display a correctly spaced appearance. Vehicle
letterers invariably devote one-half of a letter space to separate capital letters
of names. This spacing furnishes the capitals with plenty of prominence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and makes plain and distinct the whole name. Usually the half of a letter
space is placed between words. This half, however, may vary somewhat as
the size and general conformation of the surface may indicate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_095.jpg" width="600" height="455" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Grecian Alphabet.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In outlining letters many of our best vehicle letterers advise using no
inside lines, the extreme outer lines only being employed. This method of
outlining precludes the possibility of becoming confused on account of a
multiplicity of lines, the spacing may be more accurately judged, and
enlarged proficiency in free hand work is attained. Especially in the first
draft of a letter design is the use of the outside lines only to be commended.
The balance of a letter or a series of letters is that effect which gives legibility
and artistic proportions to the design. A top-heavy appearance is a fatal
defect in a letter. To properly balance a letter is to so proportion it that it
will immediately give the effect of being able, if cut out of thick board, to
stand upon its base solid, secure, and in no danger of toppling over. For a
clearer illustration of the significance of balancing letters, invert some of the
accompanying examples of X, S, Z, etc. The base of the letter S, if made
the same size as the apex, would throw the letter sadly out of balance. In
spacing and outlining a letter design, the matter of shading should be considered,
and a needed allowance made therefor if shading is to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<h3>SHADING.</h3>

<p>Many sign writers contend that shading a letter is nothing more or less
than making an artificial representation of a raised letter, and consequently
requires a fine light shade upon the top and left side of the letter, and a dark
one upon the bottom and right side. Formerly, vehicle letterers did not
admit the propriety of this way of shading, insisting that the shades should
be on the right side and bottom. Only in case of sunk-bottom vehicles were
the shades cast on the top and right side. It was considered deplorably out
of form to throw a shade to the left of the letter.</p>

<p>But the swift tide of up-to-date letter work has left its impress upon the
style of shading in vogue, and it is now remarked as admissible to cast the
shades at any desired angle and upon any desired side of the letters. Nevertheless,
it is the leading custom among vehicle letterers to cast the shading
on the right side and at the bottom of the letters. Expert exponents of the
art aver that indiscriminate shading of letters robs their work of its individuality.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_b_096.jpg" width="450" height="286" alt="Shading Example" />
</div>

<p>Properly, the shade of a letter as it is generally understood may be
defined as that letter's thickness or depth. However, that which is strictly
and correctly the shade of a letter is the "cast shadow" and it belongs to the
side opposite the thickness of the letter. The "cast shadow" usually
consists of a thin wash or glazing of the ground color, and excepting its use
upon light colored grounds, it is not extensively employed. The wagon
letterer resorts generously to letter shading, using single, double, and treble
shades, as the requirements of his business suggest. In this work, skill as a
colorist of the first order is demanded, a large amount of shading being
executed by the manipulation of glazing colors. In double or treble shading
it should be remembered that the darkest shade invariably belongs nearest
the letter. Moreover, the letter, and not the shade, should display the most
prominent color. In respect to letters laid in gold, silver, or aluminum, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
advisable to make the shade touch the leaf. Letters done in pigment are
frequently given a "free shade" which consists in permitting a small space
of the surface color to separate the letter and the shade. The "close shade"
describes the shade that is allowed to join the letter. A shade looks ungainly
and ill proportioned if made wider than the bars of the letter, excepting, of
course, the treatment of the bottom shades, which are often made a little
heavier than the perpendicular ones. This heavier bottom shading is based
upon the assumption that the sun casts a heavier shade to the bottom in proportion
to the angle of light. While the shading is generally cast against the
letter at an angle of forty-five degrees, it is necessarily inclined more nearly
to a perpendicular when the bottom of the letter is more heavily shaded than
the sides. Some alphabets do not admit of shading, and others require very
little, as compared to still others. A portion of some letters in certain styles
of alphabets would present a choked up and inharmonious appearance if
tricked out in a shade of uniform weight. Thus, B, K, G, N, S have body
angles which do not admit of so heavy a shade as perpendicular or bottom
letters. In shading it should be a paramount rule to closely study the tone
of the ground, to the end that the most natural shadow be chosen, one that
is in strict harmony with the colors of both the lettering and the groundwork.
Harmonious and effective color schemes have greatly to do with fine
results in the art of wagon lettering.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_097.jpg" width="500" height="371" alt="Shading Example" />
</div>

<p>Gold lettering on black and white grounds may be effectively shaded
with almost any color but that of the yellow order. A well-known authority
advises the use of the richest and most permanent tones of red, green, blue,
and umber shades in shading gold letters placed on colored grounds. Reds,
especially the intense and most brilliant reds, are warm, advancing colors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for shading gold letters. Imagine, if you please, a more strikingly handsome
combination than a gold letter shaded with red cast against a ground of
some one of the fashionable greens. Or reverse the style, and put the gold
letter upon a ground of carmine glazed over flamingo red, shading with
green. Blue, as a shade, produces a cool, distant effect.</p>

<p>Black letters may be usually shaded with any of the primary or
secondary colors. In shading it should be borne in mind that complementary
colors cannot always be tastefully combined. As, for instance, yellow and
orange would not look fetching to any extent when shaded with blue,
although regarded as complementary. The learner should apply himself
studiously to the study of happy and harmonious color effects in the matter
of shading.</p>

<h3>PUNCTUATION.</h3>

<p>A staid old axiom has it that "art and education are twin sisters," but
the examples of punctuation as seen in wagon lettering often met with
suggest the inference that the vehicle letterer is not slow, at times, to offer a
startling contradiction to the axiom. The sense of construction and meaning
can be quickly and effectually destroyed in a piece of lettering by a bit of
bad punctuation. The simple misplacing of a comma, period, or apostrophe,&mdash;about
the only punctuation marks deemed necessary at present to bring
out the full meaning and make symmetrical a job of vehicle lettering&mdash;often
results in disfiguring an otherwise really meritorious piece of work. The
late Mr. Geo. W. W. Houghton has defined the object of punctuation, "to
so divide written or printed sentences that the meaning may be made more
visibly clear."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/i_b_098.jpg" width="475" height="283" alt="Shading Example" />
</div>

<p>In vehicle lettering as now practiced the more striking and illuminative
words and phrases are set forth in separate lines, each line, as a rule,
carrying a different size and a different style of letter. This system of
vividly illuminating and emphasizing vehicle lettering has reduced the need
of punctuation to the minimum; but it renders the necessity of a wise and
judicious use of punctuation marks none the less imperative. In no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that we are aware of can the information which a line of lettering is intended
to convey be so clearly perverted as through the medium of a flagrant error
in punctuation. A sweep of lettering done according to the most approved
standard of letter form and construction, but improperly punctuated, is at
best only a distorted and deformed example of workmanship. The advertising
pages of the big magazines offer fine advantages for the accumulation
of reliable "pointers" upon the accepted practice of modern newspaper and
magazine punctuation. To such sources the reader is invited to go if he
would profit by the examples set forth by acknowledged masters of the art
of punctuation.</p>


<h3>ALPHABETS.</h3>

<p>The Roman alphabet is easily the most beautiful and engaging of all
the alphabets used by the wagon letterer. It is an alphabet of impressively
graceful lines, curves flowing easy rather than exact, with nothing about it
to suggest a lack of freedom or easy repose. The Roman letter, as conceived
by the modern school of American sign writers and letterers, is at once the
most picturesque and the most difficult to execute of any style known. It is
a letter of severe requirements, enforcing in its proper execution a very facile
and skilled manipulation of all the aids at the command of the workman.
Inferior quality of work cannot be concealed in the Roman letter. Every
curve of its noble form must be brought out and fully rounded if the letter is
to be what its name implies. Accompanying this chapter is a Roman
alphabet, and while there are a number of styles dignified under the title of
Roman they are all formed on the same general principle. The Roman
alphabet is deservedly held in high esteem by vehicle letterers and sign writers
the country over. It is most commonly adapted to the needs of wagon
lettering, especially. It is easily read and can be greatly extended, if necessary,
without injury to its bold and legible characteristics. The distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
features of the individual letters contained in the Roman alphabet are briefly
summarized as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_b_099.jpg" width="450" height="314" alt="Shading Example" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_b_100.jpg" width="550" height="511" alt="Shading Example" />
</div>

<p>A has its cross bar drawn at two-fifths of its height. Properly it should
be wider than the H or N. The center bar of B belongs above the center of
the letter. C is not drawn in a perfect circle. Abrupt curves should be
avoided and the exact lines of the dividers discarded. D requires care in
execution, its large sweeping curve being a difficult one to control. E goes
a bit wider than its height, with bar above center. F is frequently drawn a
trifle narrower than E. Remarks made concerning C apply to G. Keep
cross bar of H above the center. Its width should be about equal to its
height. I is very easy to make and needs no description. J is a little
narrower than the other letters. K is entitled to about the same space as H.
The cut shows where the angles of the letter meet. L and M occupy
considerably more space than other letters. N requires the same space as H.
O is a little wider than C. The necessity for this increased width will become
immediately plain to one who will first make C and then undertake to
confine O in the same circle. The proportion of P is shown in the alphabet.
Q, along with O, needs easy, sweeping curves to best display its form.
Make the appendage clean cut and bold. It has been said that a wagon
letterer's standard as an artist is determined by the quality of his Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
R's. Be that as it may, R is rightfully regarded as a difficult letter to
execute. The cross bar usually goes in at the center of the letter. The tail
of the letter constitutes the difficult point to control. S is a handsome letter,
withal a difficult one to execute properly. To ascertain the correctness of
one's S, invert the letter as drawn. Inverted the letter will be top-heavy
but it should not be built on awkward lines. T has the same height as
width. It should not be narrowed beyond the proportion here indicated, as
one often observes it in sign work. N and V may be passed without comment.
W, practically composed of two V's, is distinguished as the widest
letter of the alphabet. X occupies about the usual space and its upper part
should be smaller than the nether. Y is best known as a wide letter and
like the T, has a shape that tends to break the regularity of spacing and
leads the workman oftentimes to ruin the appearance of the letter through
the process of contraction. Z is ordinarily classed as one of the easy letters
of the alphabet to make.</p>

<p>The modified block alphabet herewith shown is executed by many
Eastern wagon letterers, and it may be said to be drawn upon pleasing and
easy lines. In display lines the modified block presents a glowingly fine
appearance, forcible, prominent, and plain enough for him who runs to
read.</p>

<p>The ornamental alphabets set forth in alphabets No. 1 and No. 2 require
no extended comment. They may be varied somewhat to meet certain needs
and necessities. The letters composing No. 2 have limbs projecting above
and below the regulation lines, and therein lies the chief beauty.</p>

<p>By the kind permission of Mr. Chas. B. Sherron, editor of <cite>Varnish</cite>, the
writer is pleased to illustrate a Grecian alphabet of decidedly unique attractions.
Wagon letterers have come to regard this alphabet with much favor,
and, if properly executed, it gives very striking effects. The embellishments
admit of innumerable changes and modifications. In point of fact, the
variations that are possible with this design are only limited by the talent of
the workman. The letters may be shaded quite as handily as other styles.
Done in gold against any dark ground they furnish beautiful and rich
effects.</p>

<p>Accompanying these alphabets are a few designs for business vehicle
panels in which examples of present day lettering are reflected from variously
ornamented grounds. From a study of them the apprentice may perhaps
find a suggestion that will lead him to originate more pretentious examples.
There are many unexplored fields of beauty in the domain of ornamental
wagon lettering, bear in mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">MONOGRAMS&mdash;ANTIQUITY OF THE MONOGRAM&mdash;HOW TO DESIGN AND
PAINT THE MONOGRAM&mdash;TOOLS NEEDED&mdash;LEADING COLORS EMPLOYED&mdash;SOME
ENGAGING COMBINATIONS&mdash;ILLUSTRATIONS, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The designing and painting of monograms is an accomplishment which
the carriage painter should zealously strive to acquire. Years ago
the crest, coat-of-arms, and other elaborate forms of ornamentation
accompanied the monogram in its mission as a panel decoration. Gradually,
in response to the dictates of the vehicle-using public, and encouraged, no
doubt, by the stern mandates of competition, the use of the lavishly
wrought style of panel ornament has given way largely to the monogram.
Despite the apparent tendency toward plain effects in the matter of pleasure
vehicle ornamentation the fact remains
unassailed that a well executed monogram
cast upon the panels of a vehicle imparts a
color effect, and breaks the monotony of a
finish, to a very satisfying extent. As my
lamented friend Manchester was wont to
say: "That little patch of color warms up
the entire job, relieving that sense of sameness
that one feels when contemplating a
carriage. No matter how nicely it is finished,
there seems to be something lacking
if the ornament is omitted. That little
color spot is like an oasis in a desert&mdash;a
resting place, as it were, for the eye." Most certain it is that the dull
uniformity, the eye offending lack of variety, in the painting of a carriage
panel is often relieved by the simple addition of a monogram. The monogram
is not of recent origin. Away back in those alluring days of Greek heroes
and Egyptian divinities the monogram existed. Indeed, early in the fourth
century, as ancient history informs us, monograms were used to identify the
pomp of power. In France the monogram was early employed in the
capacity of a signature and inscribed upon seals and coins. In point of
fact, the use and purpose of the monogram was clearly established when the
world was yet young.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_102.jpg" width="250" height="266" alt="Monogram Example" />
</div>

<p>The word monogram is said to be derived from two modest little Greek
words, <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">monos</i>, alone, only, and <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">gramma</i>, letter. Authorities differ considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in defining the word monogram. A modern authority refers to it in
this wise: "In the true monogram two of its letters, or all, for that matter,
should have some portion in common."
Again it is said to consist of "characters or
ciphers composed of two or more letters
interwoven, being an abbreviation of a
name." Still another authority contends
that the monogram is "a device formed by
the assemblage of two or more letters so as
to form a single character." Probably the
three definitions here quoted determine the
limits and significance of the monogram as
we wish to know it today. If the monogram
is formed of but two letters it is
denominated a simple monogram. Composed
of all the letters of a name it is classified
as a complete monogram. It is not the
writer's purpose to inveigh against the
elaborate and complicated monogram, which,
in some respects, at least, partakes freely of
the mystifying characteristics of an oriental newspaper advertisement, but
he does wish to emphasize the value of a monogram devoted to the use of
vehicular adornment made sufficiently plain and simple to be easily read by
one not used to deciphering hieroglyphics. "Handsome is that handsome
does," runs the quaint old axiom, and, generally speaking, the clean cut,
unencumbered, legible monogram, serves its office as a handsome ornament
when it offers to the observer a tale
soon told.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The designing and painting of
monograms constitutes an art mastered,
save in exceptional instances,
only after long continued study and
practice. Some of our best monogram
makers do not ascribe their success to
talent, but, rather, to hard work and
practice. Works on monograms furnish
plenty of examples of the different
styles (which consist, principally,
of the Florentine, script, and block,)
for the guidance of the beginner.
With such examples before him the
work of making monograms may be
begun. Mr. W. A. Thompson, probably one of the most skillful monogram
designers in the country, advises the student to "begin practice with a slate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and pencil for a time at least, as the lines can be more readily erased than
from paper." As some proficiency is gained the slate may be discarded in
favor of the writing pad, pencil and eraser. The compass
and dividers are not advised as aids to be constantly
relied upon. The general practice should be to
let these aids severely alone. Free-hand drawing
produces, as a rule, the most symmetrical and graceful
monogram. Study of proportion and balance should
early engage the thought of the learner. Curves on
one side of a monogram, for instance, should be
followed when possible by similar ones on the opposite
side. Also, as a rule, the base should be a little
sturdier than the apex. It would prove futile to attempt to append any set
of rules to govern the designing of a monogram. The principle that would
obtain in the laying out of one design would probably fail of being a principle
at all in the drawing of the second one. This by virtue of the law of
variation which rules in this as in all other arts. The letter delected from
its true course, (its standing alone not being here
considered,) either one way or the other, should,
as a matter of balance, be matched by a letter
swung in an opposite direction. If it were
possible at all times to use only those letters
which admit of an exquisite arrangement, the
problem of balance and proportion would invite
an easy solution. But such, unfortunately, is
not the case. Hence, the charm and beauty of
the monogram must necessarily be governed at times by the individual
letters of which it is composed instead of by their arrangement <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>.
The perfectly symmetrical monogram is not always possible under the
masterful touch of the most dashing originator of monogram architecture.</p>

<p>In designing a monogram for a carriage the size and formation of the
panel upon which the ornament is intended to be
used must be reckoned with. Any other details of
general construction, as applied to the vehicle,
require consideration in order that the design may
have an especial adaptation to its surroundings.
The style of the design ought, properly, to be in
strict harmony with the style of the vehicle, just as
in color the design should harmonize with the colors
employed in painting the carriage.</p>

<p>In preparing the design for a surface two methods
are given for the transference of the design from the
paper to the surface. The design being drawn on the paper, and all interlacings
clearly denoted by extra emphasized black lines, chalk or whiting is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rubbed on the back of the paper, after which it is placed upon the panel and
held carefully in position while the lines of the design are gone over with a
hard pencil. By the second method the design, after
being drawn, is perforated along its lines with a needle.
It is then laid upon the panel and with a pounce of
whiting, in case of a dark ground, and charcoal, in
case of a light one, the small dots outlining the design
are left upon the surface.</p>

<p>Occasionally the workman will wish to paint the
monogram upon paper in such a way that it can be
used as a transfer ornament. This plan is recommended
when monograms are called for upon vehicles so constantly used
that they cannot be taken from service long enough to admit of painting the
monograms in the usual way. Take first grade lithograph paper and upon
one side apply successive coatings of mucilage until a firm gloss is established.
Then outline and paint the monogram upon the gloss side of the
paper, using colors and effects that would be appropriate if the painting were
being executed upon the panel direct. The unused portion of the paper is
now cut off and moistened and the monogram, face
down, is pressed solidly upon it and maintained
in that position until dry. The monogram is
now, both back and face, perfectly sealed between
the mucilage clad paper. The paper at the back of
the ornament is next dampened little by little
until it is sufficiently saturated to permit being
lifted easily. This process completes and finishes
the shop prepared transfer monogram, and
if deftly prepared it should render satisfactory results.</p>

<p>To perform good work in painting monograms due attention must be
given the tools. These should consist of mahl stick, palette, palette cups, a
small palette knife, pounce bags, small bottles containing japan, turpentine,
etc., and a complete assortment of pencils. The pencils should be red sable
hair, set in metal, and outfitted with cedar handles. The hair had best not
exceed <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch in length, and in size the
pencils may run from knitting-needle bulk to
what pencil makers call No. 2. As a rule, a
pencil somewhat smaller than the No. 1 pencil
of commerce will be needed. In the way of
pigments the workman should provide himself
with an array of the best tube colors. A finely
prepared color is a great aid to the workman&mdash;an
aid, let me say, too rarely appreciated. The most popular monogram
colors are various shades of greens, and reds having close relationship to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
vermilion and carmine. In addition, such pigments as silver or flake white,
drop black, ultramarine blue, verdigris, burnt umber, burnt sienna, orange
chrome, Indian red, chrome yellow and Tuscan red
are used.</p>

<p>The initial of the surname, invariably to be made
more prominent than the letters of the Christian name,
will submit to strong color effects without offending
the visual sense. Perhaps it may be timely here to
say that, after recognizing the fact that the striping of
the running parts rigidly govern the color or colors of
the monogram, there are no arbitrary laws to restrict
the color schemes employed. In this as in other branches of ornamental
painting the harmony by analogy and the harmony by contrast are
recognized and adhered to. The monogram painted in relief is an illustration
of harmony by analogy. Such a monogram represents the employment of a
single color and its blended tints and shades. Harmony by contrast consists
of painting each letter of the monogram a different, but complementary,
color. The relief monogram is best done by first laying the design in a
medium shade of the selected color. Then the
shades proper of the monogram are cast in with the
dark shades of the color, and the light ones with
tints of the color. The vital principle involved in
shading is, in the words of an authority, "to shade the
under parts of the letter or object lapping it and the
opposite side on which the light falls&mdash;the shade of
the overlapped letter would naturally fall on the underlapped
letter, giving the former a raised appearance."</p>

<p>It has been said that the striping should govern the color or colors of
the monogram, as for example: If the gear be striped with carmine the
predominating color of the monogram should be carmine; if with orange,
then orange; if with green, then green, etc. Granting this, it may also be
conceded that the style and general conformation of the monogram should
in no small degree compel color effects especially adapted to it. The
symmetrical monogram calls for a precisely balanced color
scheme, while the clumsy and uncouth one, made so from
necessity&mdash;and what an inexorable task-master necessity is!&mdash;needs
a color adjustment that seeks to balance the light
parts with the heavy ones, and the heavy with the light.</p>

<p>Gold and aluminum have of late been largely used in
connection with colors and no departure from the correct
color principles has thus far been remarked, vehicle users
being especially delighted, as well they may be, with the innovation. A
practice that has seemed to please the public immensely permits laying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
entire monogram with gold or aluminum, as the painter may elect, and then
glazing the first letter, say, with ultramarine blue, the next with verdigris,
and still the next with carmine.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>If done in gold or aluminum apply a coat of rubbing
varnish over the leaf before shading and washing with
the transparent colors. Thus will the varnish check the
subsequent coatings from striking in and tarnishing the
brilliancy of the leaf. In the case of gold being used,
follow the varnish with shadings of asphaltum diluted
with varnish. The dark shades may be produced by
recoating with the asphaltum until the desired shade is
reached. Once the asphaltum is quite dry, proceed to coat those parts of the
monogram desired to be in colors with such glazing colors as carmine, ultramarine,
or cobalt blue, verdigris, etc. The shades of asphaltum are
reflected through these transparent colors to the measure of a beautiful
appearance, and the sum total of effects thus produced are particularly rich
and brilliant. The letters of a monogram painted vermilion glazed with
carmine, and the carmine then being shaded with asphaltum
and high lighted with pale canary color afford
a splendid effect.</p>

<p>In executing the script
monogram the workman will agree with us that carmine
and vermilion mixtures produce the finest color
effects. In fact, all lean bodied letters show at their
best when done in some of the gorgeous reds now popular.
A very fetching monogram, as to color, is made
by laying the design in vermilion and then glazing
part of it with carmine. Or, if the striping suggests green
for the color, lay the design in a shade of green to harmonize
nicely with the striping, and glaze a portion of it with verdigris.
Heavy bodied letters such as are combined in some of the monograms
accompanying this chapter show admirably with the upper halves done in
vermilion and the nether parts put in Indian red, or, preferably, flamingo
red. The vermilion should be given a light wash of carmine, and the letters
then outlined with deep orange. In some of the large cities where the
trappings and the suits of fashion are ever in the foreground
one may see the monogram having one of its letters tricked
out in all the finery of a graded shade. The manner of
shading consists of beginning at the top of the letter with
the palest shade of a certain color, and then gradually deepening
the shade as the painting descends until, when the
base of the letter is reached, the very deepest and darkest
shade of the color is developed. As for example, the striping
indicates the employment of green as one of the prominent colors in the
monogram. Begin at the top of the letter with the very palest shade of green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
then continuing with the various gradations down to the deepest shade. A
graded shade is most successfully accomplished with color containing a
binder of raw linseed oil to give the pigment a free working property. A
short stiff pencil, lightly, very lightly, tipped with color works most effectively
in blending each shade into the next. Reds and blues respond
splendidly to the attractions of the graded shade.</p>

<p>The high lights are justly important features of a monogram. Many
monogramists contend that a high light is almost invariably improved by
the addition of a bit of the color of the letter being executed. As, for
instance, the letter is painted medium shade of green, and the high light
goes white. To the white add a dash of the green, and note the restful,
pleasing effect secured thereby.</p>

<p>High lighting, however, as it applies to nearly all styles of monograms
is not suited to the delicate features of the script monogram. The high
lighting of the script ornament should consist in merely flicking those parts
needing a relief touch with a color that will denote a slant of light from
above.</p>

<p>The provision that permits the striping colors used upon a vehicle to
govern, with but few exceptions, the predominating color or colors of the
monogram renders a presentation of the color scheme adapted to the accompanying
designs superfluous. Therefore, it only remains for the writer to
advise his readers to learn how to design and paint monograms. It is a
buoyant and fascinating art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">PAINTING THE BUSINESS WAGON: CONSIDERED AS A WORK OF ART
AND AS AN ADVERTISING MEDIUM&mdash;VARIOUS PRACTICAL PROCESSES
GIVEN&mdash;POPULAR COLOR COMBINATIONS EMPLOYED&mdash;PAINTING
CANVAS TOPS, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Only a prophet of much temerity would attempt to bound the
possibilities of business wagon painting. It may be allowable to
define it as a limitless art, resourceful, restive, responsive to an
admirable degree to the ever-varying side-lights of technical skill. All that
art can be anywhere the broad surface of the modern business vehicle
invitingly offers to display. The time when the main requirement of a business
wagon was symmetry and strength of structure has gone by. The
merchant, the man of business, has found it to possess a value beyond its
mere capacity as a carrier of merchandise. Its worth as an advertising
medium, as an agency through which business stability and enterprise may
be widely heralded, has been fully learned. Thus the evolution of the
present elaborately painted and decorated business wagon has come about.
Is it not stating the truth too strongly to say that the average business man
is now quite as exacting and peremptory about the style and appearance of
his business wagon as he is of his much prized pleasure vehicle. He aims
to have his painter achieve a distinct individuality in the painting of his (the
business man's) vehicles, so that so-and-so's delivery wagons are readily distinguished
from all others met with along the highways and by-ways. To
this end he not only seeks to have his vehicles so painted and decorated that
unsurpassed advertising effects are commanded, but he also makes careful
selection of a combination of colors, and strictly adheres to that combination
throughout the list of his business vehicle equipment. This manifestation
of exclusiveness on the part of business men has created a spirit of rivalry
that has greatly redounded to the painter's benefit in that more beautiful
and dashing color effects are now in vastly greater demand than formerly.</p>

<p>And the gratifying aspect of the case is that these original and artistic
styles of painting the business vehicle bid fair to continue in popularity. It
furnishes the wagon painter, and most especially the apprentice in the wagon
paint shop, an incentive to excel in this branch of painting.</p>

<p>The reader may here note, perhaps, an inclination to separate wagon
painting, which we have in preceding chapters treated as an inclusive feature
of vehicle painting in its broad interpretation, from other branches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
painting art. Necessarily, in the small provincial jobbing paint shop it is all
grist that comes to the hopper; consequently carriage and wagon painting
are judiciously included under one head. In the city establishment, however,
an abrupt division is made, and we find business wagon painting
practiced as a specialty&mdash;reduced to a fine art. Many argumentative discussions
have been conducted by specialists in the two branches to prove the
superior skill required in one branch as against the other, and a wide diversity
of opinion remains prevalent as to which side has the best of the
controversy.</p>

<p>Certain it is, at any rate, that the exactions of fine wagon painting are
at present very pronounced. Granting that elegant general effects take
precedence over all other features of wagon painting, the fact remains that
the quality of the surface must be carefully looked after. It is seldom needful
to obtain as fine and satiny a surface as is required on the panel of the
jaunty brougham or the luxurious landau, the color scheme employed, united
with dignified and artistic ornamentation, being depended upon as the irresistable
attraction. However, this statement is not intended to belittle the
importance of the surfacing system. Upon the finest class of business wagons
it is a common experience to observe surfaces which in point of smoothness
and general excellence are second only to those observable upon heavy
pleasure carriages of the finest class.</p>

<p>The wagon painter is confronted by many difficulties concerning which
the carriage painter pure and simple, knows little. He must know well how
to build beautiful and durable surfaces. He should be a first-class colorist,
understanding all the features of color mixing and fully conversant with
the laws of harmony and contrast. He will likewise find it necessary to be
an unexcelled master of the varnish brush, a skilled striper, wagon letterer,
and decorative painter of established ability. The chief disadvantage under
which the wagon painter labors is presented to him through the agency of
the many lead-weighted colors which he is usually compelled to employ.
Many of the light colors extensively used in wagon painting at this time
contain keg lead, or lead of another form, as the main ingredient. In doing
jobs with light colors containing much lead, roughstuff is not generally used,
the lead medium being relied upon to furnish a sufficiently smooth, compact,
and close-textured surface; and naturally, therefore, this surface is freely
flexible and elastic. Amid the stress and strife of competition and swift
processes, these coats are often crowded on so fast that reliable drying is
not assured, and then to lend additional uncertainty to the outcome of the
work, rather quick and fairly unelastic varnish coats are employed, so that
at the completion of the work a thread of weakness gleams through the
whole paint and varnish structure. Surface building fallacies of this nature
the wagon painter is forced to contend with, and his ability to surmount
them is repeatedly shackled by rigid contrary decisions coming from the
business office. By this token, then, it is plain beyond the need of further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
demonstration, that wagon painting is an art that bespeaks for its successful
practice technical knowledge and skill of a high order. Its varied
phases, none of which are uninteresting and most of which are really fascinating,
invite study, and the cultivation of talents, both artistic and mechanical,
not required in any other recognized branch of painting. Probably the</p>


<h3>PAINTING OF A FULL-PANELED TOP BUSINESS WAGON</h3>

<p>offers more difficulties than any other style of wagon. The workman first
proceeds to clean off all the grease smears, and then takes full care to get
the job thoroughly sandpapered. Then prime job throughout, running
parts and body inside and out, top, bottom, etc. If the job is to be painted
in dark colors use the priming formula No. 1, given in <a href="#Chapter_03">Chapter III</a>. of this
series, and if light colors are desired prime with white (keg) lead thinned to
working consistency with raw linseed oil, tempered as to drying with a teaspoonful
of japan to each pint of the primer. If no time limit intervenes omit
the japan. The running parts, in due time, are next given careful sandpapering,
and then rub lead, as fully detailed in <a href="#Chapter_03">Chapter III</a>., is applied. The body
receives sandpapering and a lead coat adapted to the final color, mixed, if
the job is to go roughstuffed, with <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> oil to <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> turpentine, half and half.
Apply to inside as well as outside of body and top, then when these applied
mixtures are dry, putty, using as mixture ingredients dry white lead, 3 parts;
keg lead, 1 part; and rubbing varnish and japan, equal parts.</p>

<p>For the running parts, if to be painted in light colors, use the next coat
of pigment mixed to a brushing consistency with a trifle less than <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> oil
and a corresponding increase over <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> turpentine. Thus gradually reduce
the percentage of oil as the final color is approached. In case dark colors
are to prevail, apply over the red lead a coat of lead pigment carrying a firm
binder of oil, say one-sixteenth.</p>

<p>Upon the body, if it is to be painted in dark colors, next apply four
coats of roughstuff, choosing from among the formulas given in <a href="#Chapter_03">Chapter III</a>.
one suited to the time allowance to be reckoned with. If light colors are to
be used, and stuff coats tabooed, all the open, coarse-grained sweeps of the
surface require an application of knifing lead (again refer to <a href="#Chapter_03">Chapter III</a>.) put
on with a bristle brush and then pressed into the minute wood orifices with
a broad blade putty knife. Then in the next coat of pigment, colored
fittingly to meet the final color, reduce the oil to the proportion of one-fourth
oil to three-fourths turpentine. In the next coat which will have practically
a full percentage of the desired color the quantity of oil used, as compared
to that contained in the preceding coat, should be cut in twain. The next
reduction should bring the pigment down to possessing simply a good binder
of oil. Then, in easy procession, follow the final color coat, color-and-varnish,
if the system permits it, clear rubbing, and finishing.</p>

<p>On large top paneled jobs, however, when strictly high class results are
desired, it will be quite necessary, regardless of the colors employed, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
employ roughstuff as the body surfacing agent. The surface is brought up
to the roughstuff stage as above advised, and then, in case of a white job,
resort is had to the white roughstuff, formulas for mixing which will be
found in <a href="#Chapter_05">Chapter V</a>. of this work. The colors used over the stuff coats are
either japan ground or washed with benzine to free them as much as possible
of the oil carried.</p>


<h3>THE CHEAPER CLASS WAGON</h3>

<p>is painted by various processes in all of which the several knifing-in pigments
are esteemed factors. A moderate cost method affording very neat surface
results upon small paneled bodies, ribbed ones, etc., is executed by first giving
the body a coat of some P. W. F., the filler being applied freely and at the
proper time removed and the surface dried and cleaned up nicely with clean
rags. The chamfers on ribbed bodies are gone over with the filler. The day
following, the surface is given an application of knifing-in lead, the chamfers
getting the same treatment as the flat surface. This knifing-in lead receives a
very clean and smooth knifing, the labor of sandpapering being thus reduced
to the minimum. This coat having dried, the nail holes and other indentations
are next puttied. Sandpapering, first with No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> paper, lastly with No.
0, follows. This is made to suffice for a base to color upon, if a light color is
desired. If a dark color is wished, a coat of lead, colored to a full slate color
and mixed to dry "dead" or gloss free, is put on with a camel's-hair brush.
This effectually dresses over and obliterates surface irregularities which might
command attention upon dark surfaces, whereas upon light colored ones,
built with a strong percentage of lead, they would pass unheeded.</p>

<p>The running parts get a primer consisting of lead, 2 parts; yellow ochre,
1 part; floated in raw linseed oil. The outer or more exposed parts are next
draw-puttied with the regulation knifing lead, this to be followed in due
course with regular carriage putty, being smoothly placed in nail holes and
other cavities. Sandpapering next ensues and this, in turn, is followed with
a gloss-lacking lead coat in which the final color is well represented.</p>

<p>Perhaps a still cheaper system, as practiced in a factory shop, may be
wanted. If so, prime job throughout, body and gear, with a pigment strongly
colored with the color to be used in painting the vehicle. This primer, for
its liquid ingredients, should have raw linseed oil, <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; turpentine, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; japan,
1 teaspoonful to each quart of the mixture. Stand the work aside in a warm
room for at least 48 hours. Then thoroughly sandpaper with No. 1 paper,
after which putty holes, etc. Now take the body surface and give it a coat of
knifing lead made of dry white lead, <span class="fnum">5</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>; keg lead, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; finely ground roughstuff
filler, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>; rubbing varnish, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>; japan, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; turpentine, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>; color this lead
to meet final color. Exercise great care in cleaning off all surplus lead so
that a very light polish with No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> sandpaper will suffice to insure adequate
surface smoothness. This knifing lead will require thirty-six hours in which
to dry reliably. Then reduce the consistency of quick rubbing varnish somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with turpentine, and apply a coat to the surface. With clean linen
cloths wipe off the surface immediately. This varnish coat serves to act as
a stopper and sealer-up of the knifing lead and putty, in addition to holding
forth the subsequent color and varnish coats becomingly. One day after
putting on this varnish coat rub the surface lightly with No. 0 sandpaper to
flick off dirt atoms, etc., dust carefully, and lay the first coat of color, a
strong binder of varnish being used in both the first and second coats of color.
From this out, color, ornament, and finish in the usual way.</p>

<p>The running parts are draw-puttied on the priming coat, puttied, sandpapered
in good shape, colored, and from thence out carried rapidly to a
finish. This method affords a pretty acceptable finish, especially if tricked
out with a neat turn of ornamentation and a fine show of varnish.</p>

<p>Again the practice is observed in some establishments of painting the
running parts as just described and doing the body as follows: After priming
as usual, a coat of roughstuff mixed of lead and filler, equal parts by
weight, and rubbing varnish and japan, equal parts, thinning to an easy
brushing consistency with turpentine, is applied. After giving this coat
twenty-four hours to dry, sandpaper with No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> paper to clear off lumpy
substances, etc. Clean off surface carefully and draw-putty with a mixture
composed of dry white lead, <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; keg lead <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span></span>; liquids, rubbing varnish <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>;
japan, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>. This coat can be worked over in ten hours if necessary. Then
apply two coats of roughstuff mixed as above suggested, the two coats being
applied in one day if the limitations of time so demand. If it is wished to
avoid the use of a guide coat, and at the same time enjoy whatever advantages
are afforded by such a coat, give the last coat of roughstuff a strong
dash of yellow ochre.</p>


<h3>PAINTING HEAVY TRUCKS AND FARM WAGONS.</h3>

<p>At present this class of vehicles is painted in a way differing considerably
from that practiced formerly. Then durability was the chiefly considered
virtue. Now that fickle and flighty feature of painting is an attainment
no more earnestly worked for than is a high degree of excellence in color
effects.</p>

<p>For trucks, while a wide range of colors are popular, radiant reds and
yellows are apparently in the greatest favor. The wheels of such vehicles
are best given a coat of raw linseed oil before the tires are set. The remaining
running parts and the body parts are likewise coated with oil before the
irons are fitted, whenever it is possible so to do. It is then easier to clean
off grease daubs and finger marks left by the athletic blacksmith and his coy
young assistant. Moreover, there is a saving of time gained by this method.
The next coat should be a half-oil, half-turpentine lead coat tinted or shaded
stoutly with the color to be used in painting the vehicle, unless the color is
to be a yellow, in which case a pure white will be an entirely correct ground.
If a better job is desired apply an extra coat of lead and an additional coat of
rubbing varnish. Beautiful canary yellows are now seen on a great number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of city truck running parts. These yellows can be purchased of the manufacturers
ready for use, barring a simple thinning down with turps and the
addition of a little varnish for a binder. Upon the first coat of lead, puttying
should occur. If red or some equally positive color is to be used, color putty
accordingly. If yellow, let the putty go white. Sandpaper and smooth
surface down finely upon the first, and, if used, the second coat of lead. In
using light colors, the mechanic will find it needful to keep clean hands, as
the slightest smear makes a disfigurement not easily remedied. For first-class,
solid jobs of canary or other delicate yellow, two coats of the flat color,
and one coat of color-and-varnish will quite surely be required. The varnish
coats when used clear should be very pale, in fact, colorless. Happily, it is
now a comparatively easy matter to obtain varnishes specially adapted to
light, sensitive yellow and white surfaces.</p>

<p>Many of my readers located in the provincial jobbing paint shop will
have more or less of farm wagon painting to do. As a possible means of
aiding them somewhat in getting the job ready for the color stage of the
process, it may be said that when the job arrives at the paint shop, the first
and most important thing is to prepare the surface for the first coat of oil and
pigment. When possible it is advisable, as in case of heavy trucks, to coat
the job, prior to fitting the irons with raw linseed oil. If anything, the average
country blacksmith is given to a more lavish surface adornment of soot
smears, valve oil chromos, and scorched quarter-sections than his city brother
of hammer and tongs. Such surface defacements are all violent enemies of
durability. Their sleek and clean removal is therefore imperative. To
banish the oil and grease and soot smears, saturate a cloth in benzine and
lightly wash the surface. This fluid will loosen and quickly remove, with
the aid of a clean cloth for a final drying up, all the greasy substances. The
scorched patches require a very thorough cleaning out, a piece of glass nicely
answering, usually, for slicking off the carved wood. When the parts are
freed from the burnt particles, touch them lightly with raw linseed oil, wipe
dry with a bit of cloth, subsequently touching the places with shellac. The
priming coat, or first pigment coat, rather, should be controlled by whatever
color the job is to be painted. Putty on this coat. Then a lead coat still more
heavily fortified with the final color is in order. A coat of color-and-varnish
should suffice for a suitable base to stripe and finish upon, save in case an
extra color coat and an extra varnish coat will be needed.</p>

<p>Farm wagon bodies may get priming, a coat of knifing lead, a very
smooth sandpapering on this coat, then a coat of color, one of color-and-varnish,
then finishing varnish. If a little better surface is wished, a coat of
clear rubbing varnish, surfaced closely, will give the desired result. Dark
rich browns for the bodies harmonize effectively with almost any of the
popular yellows for running parts. Indian red, five parts; Prussian blue, one
part; with a dash of yellow to tone the mixture, give a beautiful brown.
Chocolate, maroon, and wine color, also furnish strikingly handsome results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for farm wagon bodies, when shown over running parts attired in gay coats
of yellow.</p>


<h3>COLORS FOR BUSINESS WAGONS.</h3>

<p>As already suggested, a wide variety of colors of striking brilliancy are
being used in painting business wagons. Perhaps the prevailing colors may
be referred to as the various shades of yellow, reds, and greens. Chocolates,
maroons, browns, and rich shades of blue are also extensively employed.
Many light delivery wagons are painted solidly throughout, body and running
parts, with some one of the beautiful shades of canary yellow. The
lettering and ornamental work upon the body may be done in aluminum
leaf, the shadings and striping being placed in green or blue. A full-paneled
top business wagon may be painted in this way and the color effects will be
handsome. The main body panel, lower and front panel, rich wine color;
center panel, moldings and other spaces, medium carmine; inside edge of
moldings go black, striping white. Letter in gold and shade in blue, light
and dark. Running parts, carmine; striped <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch black line, and fine line
of white. Or the body panels may be done in deep ultramarine blue, moldings
black, with letters in gold and ornaments and striping in gold and white.
Running parts, light ultramarine blue striped two round lines of white, five-sixteenths
of an inch apart. Again the main panel of body may go sage
green or a fine cream yellow. If sage green, paint lower panels merrimac
green; running parts still lighter shade of green. Lettering done in fine gold
outline, striping and ornamenting done in gold. In case main panel is done
in cream yellow, throw lower panels in carmine. Letter in gold. Running
parts go a lighter tint of cream, and stripe black to correspond with black
moldings on body. The fine line should be carmine. If desired, paint body
and running parts carmine, letter in gold or aluminum, and stripe with
vermilion. Moldings on body, black. Another combination shows the
upper panel black, lower panels and running parts, cherry red; or upper
panel black, lower panels amber brown, or deep green, with belt panel olive
green; running parts, a trifle lighter green. The upper and lower body
panel, in case of a three-panel job, may go Indian red, center panel white;
running parts Indian or Tuscan red. Letters and striping done in gold and
white.</p>

<p>A popular style of painting the ribbed body wagon is to paint body
panels dark, rich green; chambers, black; running parts, vermilion. Panels
of body striped primrose or orange yellow; running parts, black.</p>

<p>However, to mention in detail a very small part of the charming color
schemes which are sought and displayed in painting the modern business
vehicle would reach beyond the alloted limit of this chapter. Suffice it to
say that the painter has a richly blossoming and variegated field of colors
from which to select those combinations sanctioned by the esteemed and
appropriate standard of the colorist's art.</p>

<h3>PAINTING CANVAS AND CLOTH TOPS.</h3>

<p><em>Formula No. 1.</em>&mdash;Use of white vitriol one-quarter lb. in three quarts of
soft water, adding whiting until a good spreading consistency is reached.
Prime outside of top and curtains. This leaves the material nicely flexible
and coats the texture up so dense and full that a couple of coats of paint are
saved. Then with an elastic paint coat and finish in the usual way.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 2.</em>&mdash;Coat the canvas, barring curtains, with rye flour paste,
inside and out. Permit this paste to dry thoroughly. With No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> sandpaper
polish cloth lightly to knock off nibs, etc. Then coat with white lead
paint mixed with one-third raw linseed oil and two-thirds coach japan, the
mixture cut a little with turpentine. Next coat reduce the oil to a trifle less
than one-quarter oil to one-half japan, one-quarter rubbing varnish, the
remainder, turpentine. Next give coat white color-and-varnish. Rub this
coat lightly with water and pumice stone (pulverized), letter, ornament, and
finish with a durable finishing varnish.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 3.</em>&mdash;Size with hot glue water, using two coats twenty-four
hours apart. Then apply coat of keg white lead mixed two-thirds raw linseed
oil, the remaining one-third being japan and turpentine, equal parts.
After five days apply coat of lead containing three-eighths oil, two-eighths
japan, three-eighths turpentine. Then apply white color-and-varnish. Rub
lightly, letter, and finish. This is not adopted to a limited time allowance.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 4.</em>&mdash;Sponge with water top and side panels or curtains;
permit to partly dry and then coat with lead and oil coloring strongly in the
direction the final color is to be. Reduce the quantity of oil in the next coat,
and in lettering use enough oil in the colors employed to give the requisite
elasticity.</p>

<p>To paint on enameled drill, mix the pigment with raw linseed oil and
gold size japan, equal parts, and thin to the proper consistency with turpentine.
In judging the quantity of oil used, a close determination of the
percentage of oil contained in the lead should be made, otherwise an excessive
quantity of oil is apt to be used.</p>

<p>The wagon painter frequently has to letter on canvas, duck, or some
other material of similar texture not dressed in the raiment of paint. To do
this successfully various expedients are resorted to. Some workmen practice
moistening the cloth with water and then putting on the letters in paint
having plenty of oil in it. Others draw the cloth tight and firm and size it
with a solution of starch and water. Proportions, <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> water; <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> starch. Allow
this size to dry considerably before beginning to letter. Mix the lettering
pigment to a paste form in elastic rubbing varnish and thin with turpentine.
Still others make a size of cooked starch and glue water, and sponge the
parts that are to be lettered. After the letters have been placed, if the cloth
should prove to be stiff and inelastic, sponge with moderately warm water,
in this way abstracting the surplus size.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">VEHICLE REPAINTING: HOW THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF WORK ARE
DONE&mdash;MATCHING COLORS&mdash;BURNING OFF PAINT&mdash;MATERIALS USED
IN PAINTING&mdash;TREATMENT OF TOPS AND DASHES&mdash;WASHING FINISHED
WORK&mdash;SCHEDULE OF PRICES, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The re-varnishing, re-painting, etc., of vehicles constitutes an
important source of revenue for the carriage and wagon painter.
Many first-class paint shops connected with high grade carriage
manufacturing establishments do a heavy business in re-painting vehicles.
The writer has in mind a firm of carriage builders located not far from the
office of <span class="smcap">The Western Painter</span>, which employs a force of from sixty to
eighty painters. In addition to painting and finishing the manufactured
output of the establishment, consisting, it may be said, of anything in the
carriage line from a tiny road buggy to a dashing four-in-hand coach, the
force is yearly credited with from $30,000 to $40,000 worth of re-painting,
etc. From this it will be assumed that vehicle repainting, rightly directed,
affords substantial profits. Were it otherwise the firm in question would not
make it a part of their business.</p>


<h3>TOUCH-UP-AND-VARNISH.</h3>

<p>The touch-up-and-varnish job is supposed to reach the paint shop
showing but few evidences of grim-visaged service. The fact that it doesn't
uniformly do so furnishes the painter with about as much difficulty in satisfactorily
handling this class of work as he encounters in doing those classes
which have a more troublesome look to them.</p>

<p>The best profits to be gleaned from this class of work are realized when
the room space will admit of locating the job in a position where it can be
handily worked at without much unhanging, and where plenty of light may
be secured. A simple removal of the shafts, wheels, and, if necessary, top,
together with such interior furnishings as carpet, cushion storm apron, etc.,
will, in a majority of cases, suffice to clear the way for active work upon the
job, provided sufficient room space is at command. The unhanging of some
of these "touch ups" is sometimes an expensive item, especially when rusty
bolts are to be taken out and replaced. Therefore, the least possible
unhanging should be practiced. Once the necessary parts are removed, proceed
to clean off the grease smears, wiping axle arms bright, and looking
well to the fifth wheel. Benzine is a good, quick liquid agent for loosening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
grease, etc. If top is left upon the job (and it should be in most cases, when
possible), dust out the lining carefully, clean outside well, then clean out
the body interior, after which give the outside body surface a light pumice
flour and water rub as the most effective means of ridding it of possible
greasy patches, dirt nibs, etc. A close, hard rubbing should be avoided, as
upon a majority of surfaces it is prone to disclose checks and fissures, minute
or otherwise, which a single coat of varnish will only serve to bring out more
clearly, rather than to conceal. The body rubbed and washed thoroughly,
the running parts are given a careful rinsing and drying off with the chamois
skin.</p>


<h3>TOUCHING UP.</h3>

<p>Matching colors preparatory to touching up is probably the most difficult
process related to this class of work. To match colors successfully one
must have a correct eye for colors. To distinguish between closely related
tints, shades, hues, and tones, in an accurate and conclusive way, brings
into play talents, or a gift&mdash;call it what you please&mdash;not vouchsafed to the
average mortal. This is one important feature of the trade that practice
does not make perfect. The colorist does not acquire his skill by practice
merely.</p>

<p>If the fading of colors tended in one general way and to something like
a uniform degree, the successful matching of colors might be controlled in
due time by all painters interested in experimental work. Chemistry and
other scientific aids to color-making have wrought mysterious and, to the
practical man, undemonstrable factors in carriage colors. As a result, colors
fade in all the varying degrees imaginable, and are subject to so many influences
that their control, as a rule, is quite beyond the skill and practical
knowledge of the painter.</p>

<p>Many of the colors, notably the radiant reds lately so fashionable, are
naturally so fugitive that unless extraordinary care is exercised in preparing
the groundwork, they quickly fade; and, their original identity once lost, it
is a feat beyond the ability of the most masterful colorist or color matcher to
restore. To a less extent, perhaps, other colors operate in the same way.</p>

<p>The question, therefore, presents itself:&mdash;Is not the best way to match
colors to prevent their fading, so far as prevention can be made to apply?
One's doctor will affirm that a mound of prevention is worth a mountain of
cure.</p>

<p>It is not expected to make this prevention so sweeping and effectual as
to merit the title of a cure-all. But preventive measures, diligently practiced,
will lessen the fading evil, and thus reduce the work of matching
colors to the minimum. The mixing of colors, as already alluded to in
these chapters, should, so far as it is within the power of enlightened paint
shop knowledge, be made an exact process. Carelessness and guess work
are not to be tolerated. Exact measurements of all the ingredients which
go into a batch of color or paint are necessary. Then a firm insistence upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hardy, durable grounds, regardless of the hurrying shouts of the populace,
is in order. A fugitive red, or any other fugitive color, as a matter of fact,
is given a support that will add to its permanency, by adjusting the ground
color with such a strong binder of varnish that the color has a "live look" to
it&mdash;an approach to a faint egg-shell gloss, let us say. The retention of the
final color's original purity and strength is in this way made more permanent.</p>

<p>In color matching, however, which, despite our best efforts, must
continue to be a part of paint shop practice, it is best to take over to the
mixing bench a certain part of the work to be touched up, and, touching a
few inches of space with varnish so that it can be seen what the spots and
what the color as a whole will look like under a fresh coat of varnish, proceed
to gauge the matching color to it. It is a principle adhered to by many
skilled workmen in the matching of colors that the touch-up color should
contain sufficient varnish to cause it to dry with a stout gloss. A color furnished
with a strong varnish gloss will reflect more light than it will absorb,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. And the color which in process of drying absorbs more light
than it reflects, will, as a rule, when varnished over, be a different color (or
a different shade, hue, or tint of that color) than it looked to be in the mixing
pot or on the surface after it had simply dried free from "tack." An absorption
of light has effected a chemical or other change in it, and what was
judged as a close match proves a wide departure from it. Even with the
counteracting agency of varnish, a color is pretty sure to dry out lighter
than it appears in the mixing cup, so that close calculation and the exercise
of the colorist's art in a fine way is needed to get the desired match.</p>

<p>The touch-up color having been satisfactorily prepared and tested, the
felloes and all places on the job worn bare to the wood being, in the meantime,
touched with lead and oil, the work of touching first the body and
then the running parts is carried along.</p>

<p>Then the dressing of the top, side curtains, and, if need be, the dash,
ensues. The interior of the body is next varnished, then the outside surface
is flowed, and, finally, the running parts.</p>

<p>Coming next to the touch-up-and-varnish job, and by many painters
regarded as belonging to the same class, is the job that gets one coat of color,
striping, and one coat of varnish. This job offers an opportunity for deception
of which the paint shop graduates in the school of intellectual villainy
are quick to take advantage. They solemnly assure the prospective customer
that they will <em>paint</em> his vehicle for, say, $6, the price asked ordinarily
for the color and one coat varnish job. The stranger, caught by the price
and the alluring prospect of getting the job <em>painted</em>, responds to the "hold
up" until the dishonesty of the thing is revealed, as it is sure to be, by
the exacting needs of service. The color, stripe, and varnish job
calls for no little dexterity in many cases, in placing the color directly
over a hard, flinty surface of paint and varnish and making it stay for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
reasonable term of service. The surface once cleaned, as per directions in the
preceding case, the body is given a light rub with water and pumice stone
flour, and the gear is treated to a smart smoothing off with fine sandpaper.
These fine, and, to the naked eye, almost invisible scratches and furrows,
suffice to afford a foothold, a gripping place, for the color. These hard,
adamantine surfaces over which quick colors are often necessarily placed
may be classed as prolific sources of color flaking and chipping. In addition
to the sandpapering as a means of promoting durability, the use of a strong
binder of varnish in the color is advised. The one coat color, stripe, and
varnish job is quickly done and should afford a good profit.</p>

<p>The color, color-and-varnish, stripe, and finish job simply means a coat
of color-and-varnish applied over the color after it has been placed as just
described. Then a "mossing" or rubbing with hair to the extent of knocking
of the gloss of the color-and-varnish, striping, and finishing, the body surface,
of course, to get a rather light rub with water and pumice stone, both before
applying the color and after applying the color-and-varnish. Should the
body surface show signs of being fissured and cracked somewhat, it were
better to forego the rubbing with pumice stone and water, substituting
therefor a dressing down with No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> sandpaper. This provides against
moisture getting into the checks and causing trouble.</p>

<p>Following in the wake of the above class of work come the jobs that are
afflicted with all sorts and conditions of surface ailments; jobs that ought
properly to be burned off if the owners could be convinced of the economy
of the process. One way of treating a body surface threaded with fissures
consists of taking a two-inch scraper, such as car painters use, made of a file
cranked over at both ends so as to give two cutting blades, and scraping the
varnish completely off down to the undercoatings of color and paint. Follow
the scraping with a quick rubbing with lump pumice stone or a fine grade of
brick and water, avoiding even a close approach to the wood. In most cases
the cracks will, by this process, be pretty cleanly removed; when they are
not entirely slicked off the remaining vestiges are, as a rule, so faintly traced
as to give no further trouble when bridged over by the coats of lead, color,
and varnish. The rubbing once completed, the surface is given time to dry
out thoroughly; then sanding with No. 0 ensues, this, in turn, giving way to
a coat of facing lead mixed to dry without gloss, the lead being colored to a
decided slate shade with lampblack. Apply with a camel's-hair brush.
Sandpaper this coat with No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> paper; then apply color, and finish out as
previously advised in these chapters. If a different plan of filling up is
preferred, cut down the surface with No. 2 sandpaper, and first apply a lead
coat mixed of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> raw linseed oil to <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> turpentine. In 48 hours give a coat
of roughstuff made of keg lead and filler, equal parts by weight, thinned to
a stiff paste with rubbing varnish and japan, half and half, and then reduced
to a free brushing consistency with turpentine. First puttying should be
done on the lead coat, and the second one on the first filler coat. A couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
more of roughstuff coats will suffice to give the needed body of rubbing pigment.
Thus the old flinty foundation is furnished with the requisite elasticity
through the medium of the oil lead coat. The roughstuff foundation
is made to dry hard and firm, like unto the condition of the old foundation
itself, and in this way an affinity between the old and the new is established.</p>

<p>Another foundation is quickly builded by taking any good roughstuff
filler and reducing it to a spreading consistency with shellac, the first coat,
however, being made a bit thinner in body than the succeeding coats, so that
it will more readily penetrate the cracks. Three coats of this preparation
usually suffices to yield the necessary foundation free from fissures or other
blemishes. The roughstuff filler and shellac make a compound remarkably
quick setting; hence, it must be worked very quickly if smoothness of application
would be achieved.</p>

<p>Again, it is the practice in some quarters to sandpaper the old surface
down as close as possible, giving a stout coat of lead mixed with <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> oil to <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>
turpentine, and when this coat has dried for a couple of days, putty all the
deep cavities, following, the day after, with a glazing of putty over the surface,
the glazing being done with a broad putty knife, and the putty being
worked out to a uniform film and as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>In respect to the running parts, all flaky, shelly patches of surface
should be scraped. All torn and shredded places require smoothing down
nicely with scraper and sandpaper. The old remaining paint should be perfectly
solid and secure. The parts cleaned and scoured to the bare wood
had best be given a lead coat containing, as one of its liquid ingredients, at
least <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> linseed oil. The second coat, applied, like the first, with a camel's-hair
brush, may contain merely a binder of oil, avoidance of gloss being a
strictly observed rule. Then putty deep holes and indentations, following
this with draw puttying all parts in need of such treatment. Upon this lead
coat, or a second one if the owner is not averse to paying for it, the finish is
reached in the usual way, as advised in a former chapter. In painting over
these cracked, flaky, and insecure foundations, the first principle to be observed
is to get the shaky, shelly material completely removed, leaving
nothing but the firm and securely fastened pigment. The second one is to
secure as thorough an amalgamation of the old and new materials as practical
paint-shop knowledge and skill will insure.</p>


<h3>BURNING OFF PAINT.</h3>

<p>However good the crack-filling formulas may be, they are at best only
expedients of temporary value. Burning off the paint, thus getting a sure
foundation from the wood itself, is effective and free from those injurious
effects which are so often characteristic of paint removing preparations, etc.
As in the past affirmed by the writer, "with the old more or less shaky foundation,
concerning the exact nature of which no man knoweth, fairly and
cleanly removed, the painter is enabled to work from the foundation coat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the finish with the bright light of knowledge concerning the preparation and
application of the materials used, drying, action, etc., flashing through his
mind." This is why burning off is so much more satisfactory, usually, to
the painter. In the lingo of the street, he knows "where he is at," and the
measure of security afforded him.</p>

<p>To do first-class paint burning&mdash;and the other kind is not to be considered
in these chapters&mdash;the workman must be provided with a strictly reliable
and good-working lamp, burning gasoline or naphtha. To be
maintained in a condition to render satisfactory results, the flues and mechanism
require thorough cleaning and inspection before the lamp is laid
away after use. No unused fluid should be allowed to remain in the reservoir
of the lamp when it is not in use, as the vapor arising therefrom will
very shortly deposit a film of sticky substance on the surface of the flues that
will prevent a smooth and even flame when the lamp is again put into use.
And eventually, if the flues are permitted to become more or less choked up
in this way, the lamp will refuse to work at all. Explosions and accidents
of many kinds are possible with the lamp that is allowed to clog and gum
up. The burning lamp should be kept in a clean place, and show a clean,
bright surface, both interior and exterior. A couple of putty knives, one
narrow and one broad blade, a good, serviceable glove or mitten provided
with a wrist and half-arm sleeve, and a leather apron reaching well up to the
workman's chest, belong to the burner's kit, and should be kept in close
company with the lamp.</p>

<p>The operation of burning consists in simply directing the flame upon
the surface long enough to soften up the pigment and permit of its easy
removal with the knife. In a way, "burning off" is a misnomer. To
literally burn the paint off, as the apprentice might possibly construe the term
if not otherwise enlightened, would result in charring the wood to a harmful
extent. Begin burning at a part of the surface which will allow the softened
paint to be thrown off over a portion of the surface still coated with paint.
As the knife is usually handled with the right hand it is best to begin burning
on the left side of the panel. Thus the softened paint is thrown to the right
and across the unburned portion of the surface. It is a wise rule to remember,
in connection with this work, that a job burned right is in a fair way to be
painted right. If through an accident or otherwise the surface should get
scorched in places, a complete scraping out of the burned wood fibres will be
necessary. Then with equal parts of raw linseed oil and turpentine touch
just the charred patches. After a solid block sandpapering, the surface may
be taken in hand and conducted to a finish in the usual way.</p>

<p>In the case of a Berlin coach, perhaps the quantity of each item of
material should be increased over the above to the extent of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> for the body
surface. Running parts require the same quantity. The body of a six-passenger
rockaway will need, approximately, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> less material than the body of
the landau or coach. The body of the coupe-rockaway <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> less. Running
parts consume about the same quantity as the heavier vehicles here named.</p>

<p>Such light pleasure vehicles as surreys, cabriolets, etc., require an
increase in the quantity of each item of material over that accorded to the
buggies and phaetons of about one-half.</p>

<p>The above tables may be of benefit to some of my readers who desire a
practical basis upon which to estimate the cost of the material to be used
upon a certain vehicle. Labor is said by competent authorities to represent
75 per cent of the cost of painting a vehicle. With the cost of material at
hand&mdash;a computation made comparatively easy by the aid of the tables here
set forth&mdash;and with 75 per cent of the whole cost credited to the labor item,
a very close estimate upon general vehicle painting can be made.</p>

<p>Guess work in gauging the price of a job of vehicle painting paves the
way to an unprofitable business venture; more surely in these days of uproarious
competition than in times past. Careful estimates, which include
cost of labor, material, shop rent, wear and tear of tools, and such other
incidental features of business which may properly be taken note of in an
estimate, have come to be imperative necessities in carriage and wagon
painting. Verily, it is true that it is not all of painting to paint&mdash;<em>estimating</em>
should be included therein.</p>


<h3>TOPS AND DASHES.</h3>

<p>The proper care and treatment of carriage tops and dashes forms one of
the significant features of the re-painting business. About every class of
citizens who have to do with carriages&mdash;the trimmer, harness-maker, livery
man, blacksmith, hack-driver, and jockey&mdash;regularly come forward bubbling
over with advice and formulas for the preservation of tops; but usually the
paint shop is resorted to as the Court of Appeal. The aim of the painter
should be to impart to the top and dash a finish which will correspond to
that given the other parts of the vehicle, at the same time furnishing the
leather or rubber a preservative agent that will provide reasonable durability.</p>

<p>In every jobbing paint shop a space should be set apart for the safe and
clean storage of tops and dashes; also cushions, carpets, and other interior
furnishings. In the space selected for the purpose a rack made to conform
to the size of the space may be erected. Build it to consist of two tiers, with
a half-story tier above for the holding of cushions, carpets, etc. If the space
is large enough, make the rack, say, 12 feet long, 10 feet high, and 4 feet
wide. The two first tiers will hold six buggy tops. The rack is made of
1-inch and 2-inch stuff, hemlock, say, and need not cost to exceed $1.50.
Tops that are regularly calashed will require only half space. Under no
circumstances should a top be calashed and stored away in the shop unless
it has been used and subject to such treatment. The top (and the dash also,
when removed), upon removal should be cleaned thoroughly before being
set away. If the top joints need a coating of lead it should be given them
prior to placing them in the rack or permanent storage place. It is bad
policy to defer painting and finishing such parts until it is nearly time to
hang off the other parts of the vehicle. A uniform quality of finish cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in this way be secured. The irons on tops, if chipped, rusted, etc., require
lead, often a facing with putty, color, color-and-varnish, a light rub with
pumice stone flour and water, and finishing with a good hard drying varnish.
A few days before the vehicle is finished the top belonging to it may be taken
in hand, the lining carefully dusted out, and the leather or rubber sponged
off and dried over with a chamois skin. The further treatment may depend
upon the material of which the top is composed. A great many vehicle
owners, livery men in particular, prefer to have leather tops&mdash;except the
badly worn ones&mdash;go without a dressing of any kind, a simple washing with
castile soap and soft water being thought to amply suffice. Hand-buffed
leather tops in good condition, in the writer's estimation, require no dressing;
the machine-buffed ones, however, are benefited by a thin, evenly-applied
coat of some strictly reliable enamel top dressing. And it is pertinent here
to say that even the best of dressings, those which long usage has sanctioned
as of established value, are of such a nature that they are beneficial only
when applied sparingly. A dressing, to be genuinely useful to the carriage
painter, should preserve the enamel of a top, strengthen the leather or
rubber, and enable it to retain its natural flexibility for the longest possible
period.</p>

<p>If, then, the top be rubber or machine-buffed leather, apply dressing,
not forgetting the side curtains. If a leather top and the owner wishes it to
be given some preparation other than the regulation enamel top dressing of
commerce, the following formulas may be used, the two first being particularly
beneficial to the leather.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 1.</em>&mdash;Neatsfoot oil, 1 pint, beef suet, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> lb. Melt the oil and
suet together. Then add a tablespoonful of melted beeswax, mixing the
ingredients carefully, and confining in an air-tight vessel. The beeswax has
a cooling property greatly to be desired in a leather preservative.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 2.</em>&mdash;Darken neatsfoot oil with a drop black. Apply
sparingly and rub out well with soft rags. This formula does not give the
brilliancy of finish that an enamel dressing does, but it gives to the leather a
softness and pliability not obtained otherwise.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 3.</em>&mdash;Adapted for either rubber or leather. Of finishing varnish,
1 quart; beeswax, 1 oz; drop black, sufficient to color mixture properly.
Thin to a brushing consistency with the turpentine. The worth and reliability
of No. 3 is vouched for by a jobbing shop painter of twenty-five years'
experience.</p>

<p><em>Formula No. 4.</em>&mdash;This provides for the use of boiled linseed oil stained
with drop black thinned with turpentine. Apply this preparation with a
brush, rubbing it out well and uniformly. Set aside for 30 minutes; then
with clean soft rags, rub the mixture off, polishing until a clean cloth shows
no stain when rubbed over the leather. Places which show cracks and hard
service will need a second coating with the mixture. The leather is not
thickened with this mixture, has no unusual attraction for dust and dirt, and
will remain soft and flexible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Fine grained leather dashes, fenders, etc., which do not look worn or
rusty, appearing only soiled and somewhat smeary, may be gone over with
a cloth saturated lightly with kerosene oil, and then polished with soft
woolen rags.</p>

<p>The commoner grades may be given patent enamel dressing, or, if preferred,
a thin coat of drop black rubbed off immediately with soft rags and
then flowed with a first-class finishing varnish. If much worn, they may
be greatly freshened up and renewed if treated with some of the formulas
given herewith.</p>


<h3>MARKING AND METHODS OF IDENTIFYING VEHICLES AND THEIR PARTS.</h3>

<p>The jobbing paint shop requires and should be given a system of
marking and tabulating all work taken in, so that when the finish is reached
and hanging off occurs, valuable time need not be wasted in searching for
mislaid and unidentified parts, such as cushions, carpets, storm aprons, and
the like. Unless each part is carefully marked with a properly filled out
tag attached to said part, and an itemized entry made in the receiving book
fitted with printed forms, a filled out form being given the vehicle owner
and a duplicate copy retained by the painter, "confusion worse confounded"
may be expected to occasionally occur. The following is a blank form which
the writer several years ago published and, having seen it in use in the
painting business, he can cheerfully endorse its merits as a practical working
form:</p>

<h3>WASHING FINISHED WORK.</h3>

<p>The duty of the painter does not end with the hanging off of the finished
vehicle. He has still one other important mission to perform, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
proffering advice to the vehicle owner upon the preservation of carriage
surfaces. Such advice may be directed along the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>Carriages require storage in apartments free from dampness, furnished
with plenty of light, invited if possible, from all sides, and entirely removed
from the stable and its attendant emanations of ammoniacal gases. Ammonia,
make the vehicle user understand, is a deadly enemy to colors and varnish.
Brick walls may also correctly be classed as paint and varnish enemies
causing loss of lustre and general deterioration. A newly-varnished vehicle
surface is greatly benefited, once the varnish is sufficiently hard to permit
it, by frequent washings with clean cold water. Premature water baths,
however, are to be avoided, save when made absolutely necessary by reason
of mud spotting or other accidents of that order. The suggestion one hears
occasionally offered to the effect that a surface may be safely rinsed with
water three days after being finished is not founded upon practical paint-shop
or varnish-making philosophy, so long as it is made to apply to a high-grade
elastic varnish. Such a varnish may be, to a mere finger touch, quite
dry, but in reality only the outer film is partially dry, and putting it into service
or submitting it to a cold water bath are each in their turn risky experiments.
The fact that an elastic varnish has reached the free-from-dust
drying stage should not be taken as a trustworthy indication that the time
for washing has arrived.</p>

<p>There is no question concerning the benefit of a cold water rinsing to a
varnish surface that has well hardened as to its outer film. Frequent washings
will then improve its lustre and durability. It must always be taken
into consideration that in the case of first-class painting, assimilation of the
various varnish coats ensues, and a fair measure of time is therefore necessary
after the application of the finishing coat ere the washing can be safely
given. In washing a varnish surface, gaseous impurities which so readily
accumulate, are removed.</p>

<p>Varnish, when at a certain temperature, is susceptible of contraction
when any colder body is brought in contact with it. This is the controlling
principle of varnish washing. The contraction of a not properly hardened
varnish, after cold water is applied to it, causes the liquid gas of the varnish
to escape through the medium of evaporation. Drying, according to the
natural laws of drying, a varnish retains those elements which add to its
brilliancy and elastic properties. When forced to dry by virtue of premature
cold water flooding, unfavorable results may be expected to follow.</p>

<p>Washing a newly-varnished vehicle should never occur under the bright
glare of the sun. Plenty of water flooded gently upon the surface with a
soft sponge is a necessity in the washing process. Dirt accumulations, if
any, are softened and carried from the surface under the volume of water.
After a careful sponging, the surface may be dried off nicely with a clean
lint-free chamois skin. If a hose be used, it should be adroitly wielded, and
the stream so gauged that no harm can come to the surface from the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pressure. The hose in the hands of an incompetent coachman is the cause
of a great many accidents to freshly laid varnish.</p>

<p>Caution the washer against wetting the inside of the carriage body.
Glue joints, etc., do not strongly resist the attacks of water. Under no circumstances
permit water to dry on the surface. Stains more or less pronounced
are almost sure to follow. Hot water, soapy water, or water not
strictly clean should not be allowed to come in contact with a surface of
varnish. Do not allow mud to dry upon the surface. Wash it immediately
upon its return to the carriage house after being run in the mud.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="chapterheader">A STUDY OF MATERIALS: WHITE LEAD, ITS PURITY, ETC.&mdash;QUALITY OF
COLORS IN GENERAL&mdash;ADULTERATION PRACTICALLY CONSIDERED&mdash;PURITY
OF RAW LINSEED OIL&mdash;TURPENTINE&mdash;TESTING COACH JAPAN&mdash;VARNISH.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The name of a thing should not be accepted for all there is to the
thing itself. The carriage painter has very pronounced reasons for
bearing this fact in mind when engaged in studying and passing
judgment upon the materials he finds it needful to use in his business. Probably
the most important pigment which finds its way into the carriage and
wagon paint shop is white lead. This pigment has afforded a theme for
increasing discussion, its qualities and adaptability having been extensively
canvassed. Numerous substitutes have been introduced during the past two
decades, but white lead still retains its pre-eminent popularity. Lead compounds
and various adulterated brands have given the painter plenty of
trouble, and caused him to devote more attention to the quality of his white
lead stock than formerly. Because of its soft, pliable, grain-filling property,
its established elasticity, density, body, fine working quality, and its merits
as a reliable drying pigment, white lead is the filling up and foundation
material <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>The purity of lead deserves the carriage painter's first consideration. It
has been practically determined that a pure lead, endowed with all the virtues
which should distinguish pure lead, when mixed and used in combination
with other pigments or colors, holds its quality better and is less susceptible
of change than a compound or adulterated lead. Moreover, pure
white lead, with its soft, fine, elastic texture, has a natural adhesiveness, a
surface-filling and leveling-up property, which the impure lead carrying a
percentage of gritty, flinty ingredients does not possess. The pure lead
works out under the brush more pleasantly and with less brushing than the
compound, and it dries with greater uniformity, etc.</p>

<p>At the same time it is well to remember that a strictly pure lead may
have a number of features in its make-up decidedly objectionable to the carriage
painter. It may be imperfectly washed, or it may be too coarsely
ground, etc. In his study of white lead, then, the painter will find it a
matter of value to determine the adaptability of the lead to the requirements
of his business. After convincing himself of the purity of the lead, it remains
for him to test for fineness of grinding. A lead ground fine&mdash;impalpably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
fine, if it please my readers&mdash;lightens the labor of sandpapering,
strikes into the wood fibres stoutly, and covers the maximum surface space.
It has good coloring and covering power when mixed with colors to form
tints, and for other important parts which a white lead plays in vehicle
painting it is especially adapted.</p>

<p>Nor should a carriage lead be ground in too large a percentage of oil.
For coats between priming and color but comparatively little oil is needed,
and washing out with benzine or turpentine entails an unnecessary amount
of labor. Hence, it should be insisted upon that carriage painters' lead be
ground moderately stiff in oil, so that protracted washing-out may be avoided
on the one hand, and extended mixing and breaking-up operations shunned
on the other. A practical and, at the same time, a conclusive test of fineness
is furnished by taking two pieces of plate glass 8×8 inches in size, setting
them securely in blocks of wood, and then smearing a couple of small
flakes of the lead, rubbing the pieces of glass together. Continue rubbing
with a firm, even pressure until a uniform distribution of the pigment and a
thorough impact is established. The glasses should then disclose the nature
of the grinding. To learn the drying power of the lead, take the palette knife
and slick a small quantity over the glass and set aside, noting the time consumed
in drying. A lead ground in the proper proportion of oil for carriage
work should, as taken from the keg and smeared in a thin film over the
glass, dry in twelve hours so that the finger may be passed over it without
sticking.</p>

<p>What has here been said in reference to chemical purity or strictly pure
as a necessity in the white lead product does not apply to all the pigments so
useful to the vehicle painter. For reasons here shown lead extenders and
lead compounds should be emphatically objected to. A disavowal of their
worth as carriage painting pigments, however, in no wise lessens the significance
of the fact, as already pointed out, that a strictly pure lead is very
often an expensive, if, indeed, it be not a worthless, lead to buy. Chemically
pure is not invariably an accurate gauge of quality. A chemically pure lead
that has not fineness to recommend it lacks an essentially vital quality. In
respect to the pigments and colors following in the wake of white lead it has
been made plain on many a hard-fought field of experiment that the color
consumer, the practical painter, the workman far removed from the analytic
gentleman of the laboratories, is chiefly concerned in getting a pigment or
color adapted to his needs more completely than any other available one. It
may not be chemically pure as the chemists would construe the term; but if
it responds satisfactorily to a practical test, it is then serving the painter's
practical need. As declared by the writer, in an article published some
time ago, "a color or pigment may be pure in the sense that it is not adulterated,
and still fall short of being chemically pure. It is the duty of the
consumer to avoid buying, under the label 'strictly pure,' an adulterated
color. The real color contained in such a product is then costing him considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
more than would a color in a state of purity." The chemist and
the practical painter do not agree oftentimes upon what may be called adulterants.
Once upon a time, as the fairy books say, at a painters' convention
the chemist employed to make an analysis of chrome yellow stated in
substance that practically everything outside of the chromate of lead should
be classed as an adulterant or as a matter out of place. The practical painter
who has looked up the subject of chrome yellow manufacture could tell the
chemist in this case that he has signally failed to take into consideration the
necessary constituents of the different shades of chrome yellow. As, for example,
acetate and nitrate of lead, bichromate of potash and bichromate of
soda, sulphate of soda, etc., are constituents of a pure chromate of lead. And
our friend, the chemist, would tell us that a chromate of lead composed of
some of the above ingredients is not a chemically pure article. What the
carriage painter, the consumer, will find it of value to ask himself is this:
Does a given pigment or color suit the requirements of my business? If in
doubt as to the utility of the given pigment or color, then an immediate
practical test should be resorted to. It is not the purpose of the writer to belittle
the position or the usefulness of the chemist. The value of a chemical
analysis in the detection of adulteration and in explaining how a color is
made is cheerfully acknowledged; but after the chemist's deduction must
follow the practical test. In conducting a practical test the foremost aim of
the painter should be to consider the color or pigment to be tested in relation
to the object for which it is intended. Shade, brilliancy, working property,
durability, etc., are entitled to a careful and chief consideration in a test for
quality. And a test for quality, if conducted painstakingly and thoroughly,
will disclose the real value of the material to the consumer. When extenders
are added to a pigment for the sole purpose of enriching the manufacturer
at the expense of the consumer, the practice becomes adulteration, pure and
simple. If, however, such extenders are used to, and actually do, increase
a pigment's usefulness, fortifying it in a way and to an extent that it needs
to be fortified, the painter will not attempt to question its commercial value.</p>

<p>The study of the pigments which the vehicle painter calls to his uses is
a feature of business deserving the most rigid attention. Carried on watchfully
and with a vigilant regard for details, it cannot well fail to increase
paint shop profits.</p>


<h3>LIQUID MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>In the consumption of liquid materials the vehicle painter has no use
for extenders. Unfortunately, however, the thrifty and shifty sons of adulteration,
after the manner of Marco Bozzaris, in the Fourth Reader, are
struggling, tooth and nail, to adulterate linseed oil and the turpentine product
in a way to defy detection.</p>

<p>What the cathode ray is to a certain branch of science, pure raw linseed
oil is to carriage and wagon painting. Back in a somewhat indefinite period
of the past, linseed oil pre-empted the chief claim in the domain of paint and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
varnish, and its right to a royal office in that domain has never yet been successfully
disputed, notwithstanding the fact that a flood of substitutes and
counterfeits have been turned loose upon the market. In the language of
another, "Raw linseed oil is the king of the paint realm. There are lots of
usurpers in the field but they are short lived. The true homage of the
brotherhood of the brush continues to be paid to the old stand-by. It is the
gold of the paint shop currency."</p>

<p>In the basic stage of carriage and wagon painting, pure raw linseed oil
is conceded to be the life of the pigment. Impure or adulterated linseed oil&mdash;the
spurious, fraudulent article, if you please&mdash;has more to do with the
premature decay of paint and varnish than one at first thought might concede.
During the process of painting there are numerous complications
which, by the harsh reality of scientific analysis, could be directly traced to
the insidious effects of an adulterated brand of oil. Investigations conducted
by competent experts have shown that the self-assertiveness of adulterated
oil is determined, not so much by apparent unfavorable effects upon the
under coats, but rather from its resistless attack upon the lustre and durability
of the finishing varnish. Some of the oils used to adulterate linseed
oil are pronounced by such authorities as Hurst and Terry to be good driers,
although, as in the case of rosin oil, they may seemingly dry good upon the
surface only to soften up later on. And provided these adulterant oils are
not good driers, the people engaged in floating them along the avenues of
trade have simply to add a certain proportion of drying japan to O. K. them
in this respect.</p>

<p>The vehicle painter's practice of using raw linseed oil insures him somewhat
against oil adulteration, as it is much more difficult to adulterate the
raw linseed product than the boiled and have the fraud go undetected. A
raw linseed oil when fresh and new is of a bright yellowish-green color,
and as it grows older it becomes paler in color and perhaps a little brighter.
When spread on a surface in a thin film and exposed to a pure dry air it will
harden quite solidly in from forty-five to fifty hours. It ranks as reliable
drying oil, promptly solidifying when acted upon by peroxide of hydrogen
or by subnitrate of mercury. A non-drying oil refuses to show a change of
this kind. Combining powerfully with oxygen, it offers, when dry, a
stronger resinous character than any other oil.</p>

<p>Probably the chief adulterants of linseed oil should be listed as rosin,
mineral, and fish oil; cottonseed oil being looked upon with less favor than
formerly, while hempseed oil, owing to its pronounced tendency to change
color, is not much in evidence at present.</p>

<p>Rosin oil is strictly an unreliable drier. It toughens the working property
of paint and is deficient in all the essentials which should distinguish a
good paint oil. Its low flash point, as indicated by Hurst,&mdash;300° to 330°
F.&mdash;together with its strong rosin odor when heated, would appear to make
it an easily-detected adulterant. Deodorizing processes have of late served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to fortify this oil, and fish oil as well, against detection by the sense of smell.
Fish oil, chiefly the product of the menhaden fishing industry flourishing so
vigorously along the Atlantic coast, has naturally an offensively fishy odor,
particularly when heated. Its main recommendations as a linseed oil adulterant
are tersely summed up by Terry as follows: The rapidity with which
it oxidizes, and its good body, render it not unsuitable as a vehicle for paint.</p>

<p>The low cost of mineral oils, including coal oil and petroleum, has caused
them to become highly regarded as linseed oil adulterating mediums. Mineral
oils more unfavorably affect the drying property of paint than its working
and spreading property.</p>

<p>Cottonseed oil belongs to the non-drying class of oils, but since recent
processes have made possible the elimination of the pronounced acrid taste,
its presence in linseed oil by the sense of taste is not easy to expose.</p>

<p>Hempseed oil is a mean tasting, mean smelling, but good drying oil,
and only because of its rapid color changes, wearing finally to a dull brown,
is its employment in linseed oil restricted to narrow limits.</p>

<p>In testing for linseed oil adulteration, ammonia is often effectively used,
equal parts of the ammonia and oil being employed. Cottonseed oil under
the ammonia treatment shows an opaque brown. When it is present in linseed
oil the liquid goes to an opaque yellow. Fish oil under the effects of
ammonia goes white. Rosin oil will disclose its presence in linseed oil if
confined in a bottle, with alcohol added in the proportion of five parts of alcohol
to one part of oil, and smartly shaken, the alcohol afterwards being
poured off. A clear sugar-of-lead solution is added to the oil, and should
rosin oil be an ingredient a cloudy precipitate will manifest itself. A practical
and simple test often used in the carriage paint shop consists in taking
a couple of test tubes and putting a quantity of linseed oil of known purity
in one tube and a quantity of suspected oil in the other, then immersing the
tubes in warm water for, say, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> of an hour, and immediately upon removal
from the water pouring the pure oil into the tube of suspected oil. If any
impurity exists, different colors will form in layers. And it may be here
proper to say, in passing, that in making tests and comparisons of materials,
an article of established purity and quality should be used as a standard.
Some time ago a well-known paint firm issued a card giving some easy and
practical tests for the detection of linseed oil adulterants, and knowing their
value to the vehicle painter, the writer herewith appends three tests:</p>

<p>No 1.&mdash;Shake equal parts of oil and strong nitric acid in a small white
glass vial or bottle, and allow to stand from fifteen minutes to two hours.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Detection of linseed oil adulterants">
<tr><td></td><td></td><td class="spaceout xsmallfont">UPPER<br />STRATUM</td><td class="spaceout xsmallfont">LOWER<br />STRATUM
</td></tr><tr><td class="talignleft">Pure<br />Linseed oil</td><td><span style="font-size:2.4em">&#125;</span></td><td class="spaceout">Muddy<br />olive green</td><td class="spaceout">Almost<br />colorless

</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Shake with concentrated solution of potash or soda, and then
add warm water and shake again. Allow to stand half an hour, and if any
petroleum (paraffine oil) is present it will separate from the soap.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Put samples of oil in tubes and place them in a freezing mixture
(2 parts ice or snow, 1 part salt). If the oils solidify at 0° or 10° to 13°
F., then cottonseed oil is probably present. (Pure linseed oil solidifies at
17° F.)</p>

<p>The hydrometer should be among the possessions of every well-regulated
paint shop. It is an inexpensive little instrument, and for testing turpentine
it is unsurpassed, while for the detection of cottonseed and mineral
oil in linseed oil it is a quick and active agent. First test a brand of linseed
oil of absolute purity; and such an oil, bear in mind, should not vary <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>
degree from 20° to 60° Fahr. In the case of a 20% addition of mineral oil to
linseed oil (the same temperature being maintained in testing both the pure
and the suspected samples) the specific gravity will be <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>° less than the
pure oil. A 25% addition of cottonseed oil will be 1° lower. Fish oil being
of about, if not quite, the same specific gravity as pure linseed oil, the adulterator
can beat the hydrometer.</p>

<p>Pure raw linseed oil is so essentially a part of durable carriage and
wagon painting that especial attention should constantly be directed to the
oil supply.</p>

<p>In respect to his purchases of turpentine the painter should be likewise
cautious and investigating. The adulteration of turpentine with headlight
oil, or a lower grade of kerosene, and with 112 fire test oil has been, and
continues to be, actively carried on. This 112 fire test oil, as employed in
small southern distilleries not shadowed by inspectors, shows a list of ingredients
closely corresponding to, heavy paraffine oil <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; kerosene, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>; light
oil, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>. Thus a gravity is provided which registers about the same as pure
turpentine and is therefore very difficult to detect. The naval authorities
practice&mdash;and it is said, successfully&mdash;the old-time test of dropping the suspected
turps on a piece of white paper alongside of a pure brand of turps and
watching the result. The turps containing the 112 fire test oil will leave,
upon evaporation, a faint but decided <em>greasy</em> stain. Pure turpentine not too
rapidly distilled will leave no spot. The turpentine containing traces of the
crude gum due to too rapid distillation will impart a sticky, yellowish-white
stain to the paper and this the painter should not confound with the afore-mentioned
<em>greasy</em> stain of the adulterated turps. In our Eastern, Middle,
Western, and Northwestern cities the practice of kerosene oil injection is the
favorite method of cheating the consumer. The sense of smell will sometimes
detect the presence of kerosene; the white paper test will sometimes
expose it; and again both tests will fail, along with the other usual ones.
While so keen an authority as Mr. Geo. B. Heckel, of <cite>Drugs, Oils and
Paints</cite>, has acknowledged that the adulterators can cheat the hydrometer to
a certain extent, it cannot be done with the same measure of profit and impunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
as formerly. Mr. Heckel has publicly advised consumers to insist
on 31° turps, prefacing the advice with the following noteworthy declaration:
"If I were a painter I would never accept a gallon of turpentine without
sticking a hydrometer into it, and if it registered above <span class="nowrap">31 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>° or below
<span class="nowrap">30 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>° I would not accept it from the United States Treasury."</p>

<p>What vehicle painter vested with the authority of purchasing the turpentine
supply for a painting business, be that business big or little, can
afford to disregard Mr. Heckel's admonition? To pay turpentine prices for
kerosene oil is a disastrous drain upon the resources of a painting business,
in addition to furnishing the materials used an element of insecurity, a germ
of decay, sure to disturb the durability and comeliness of a painted surface.
For it is, or should be, in fact, clearly understood that the kerosene or fire
test oil adulterants do not evaporate like turpentine when put into a pigment
and spread upon a surface. They strike into the wood or pierce the nether
coat of pigment, causing, later on, the flaking and peeling of the pigment;
or they retard the drying of colors; and again, they lend a peculiar roughness
to the surface, like unto that imparted by benzine when used in a fine
coach color.</p>

<p>The carriage and wagon painter has substantial reasons for being interested
in coach japans, for upon their quality and judicious employment the
durability of his work greatly depends. The many and beautiful colors which
he uses almost daily are japan ground, and the pigments and colors shop-mixed
are invariably fortified with the ever-useful coach japan. The wide
variety of names applied to the drying materials used in the painting business
has been the source of annoyance and confusion to the practical mind.
In reality, however, there are but three kinds&mdash;coach japan, specially adapted
for colors to be quickly dried and containing no oil; liquid drier (or dryer)
intended for the drying of oil and oil paint; and patent driers purchased in
paste form, effective only when used in conjunction with oil. The patent
driers are so little used at present that they scarcely merit a notice.</p>

<p>Coach japan, with the merits of which the carriage painter has a right
to be concerned, being chiefly used, as before stated, in colors containing no
oil require, for purposes of protection and as a service-insuring medium,
blanketing under one or more coats of varnish.</p>

<p>It is not to be understood that coach japan will not combine with and
dry oil colors; its power in this capacity, however, is less than that of a
liquid drier, while its gummy nature shows a tendency to cause surface disturbances
of the cracking and blistering order&mdash;most emphatically so when
strictly exact proportions are not maintained. Its adaptability, therefore, is
best confined to colors containing no oil.</p>

<p>So much of uncertainty, so much that is injurious and fatal to the durability
of colors, is embraced in the employment of japan in excessive
quantities or of an inferior grade that the painter should not be slow in determining,
by practical tests, both strength and quality. And to make such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
tests easy, not to mention other convincing reasons, need we invoke the purchaser's
attention to the importance of buying only standard makes?</p>

<p>A first-class coach japan, as a rule, will show a color moderately light,
and when mixed with oil should manifest no disposition to curdle. Such a
japan, too, should, when floated in a thin film over a glass or other strictly
non-porous surface, dry firm and without brittleness in four hours. To observe
how the japan unites and assimilates with linseed oil, take a pane of
window glass, that furnishing a surface non-porous and decidedly free from
suction, and attaching a sheet of white paper on one side as a means of better
showing the action of the oil and japan, drop on the reverse side of the glass
about four drops of raw linseed oil. Then affix, say, a single drop of japan
in close proximity to the oil, immediately inclining the glass so that the
japan may come in contact with the oil. If the drier promptly unites and
takes kindly to a close relationship with the oil without curdling or showing
other evidences of disagreement, it will merit the approval of the painter.
Another easily-conducted test consists in comparing the japan of unknown
quality with one of acknowledged merit, by taking the samples and confining
them in bottles containing raw linseed oil, shaking the contents and
then standing aside for at least twenty-four hours. The proportions of oil
and japan may be in the ratio of 5 parts of oil to 1 part of japan, exactly the
same proportions being adhered to in all the samples tested. At the expiration
of twenty-four hours one can see which sample mixes best with the oil.
The samples then poured in a thin film over a piece of glass and allowed to
stand will determine the drying property of each. It will also be useful to
learn by observation and comparisons if the japan holds well in solution. A
japan that fails to do this is not valuable in carriage and wagon painting.
Study should be made as to how and to what extent the japan effects the
light and delicate colors at present so extensively used. In point of fact, the
painter should not weary in investigating the qualities and characteristics of
his coach japans, and what they are capable of doing. To establish their
real value will mark an achievement of the first order in the economy of
painting.</p>

<p>In regard to varnishes the buyer can find no excuse for putting aside the
fact that quality and not price should determine the value of his supply; and,
happily, he has it within his power in the active prosecution of his business
to demonstrate the good or bad quality of varnish. It may frequently prove
an expensive experiment; and herein is disclosed an apparently good and sufficient
reason for the painter's disinclination to change from the use of one
make of varnish to another. The varnishing stage of painting may be said
to be in a critical period at all times, and having established the quality of
his varnish supply, the responsible party in the matter is naturally opposed
to changing in favor of a make with which he is not practically acquainted.
At the same time, a practical test of different strictly reliable makes is the
only way of deciding to one's own satisfaction which is the best, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
most economical to buy. Any first-class finisher can very soon determine
the working property, brilliancy, depth of lustre, drying quality and general
behavior under varying circumstances and conditions of different varnishes.
Nevertheless, that primary requisite, durability, is not so easily nor
so promptly established. This essential quality can be determined only
after protracted trials upon vehicles engaged in active service, the painter
retaining carefully tabulated data bearing upon each make of varnish under
observation, the character of the service to which it is exposed, etc. Thus,
in due season, may the actual merits of a varnish be defined.</p>

<span class="chapterheader">CUTTER AND SLEIGH PAINTING: DECORATIVE ASPECTS OF THE WORK&mdash;THE
VARIOUS PROCESSES OF PAINTING EMPLOYED&mdash;THE PREVAILING
COLORS&mdash;STRIPING AND SCROLLING&mdash;REPAINTING, REVARNISHING,
PROFITS TO BE REALIZED, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Cutter and sleigh painting are justly esteemed interesting parts of
the art of vehicle painting. Coming at a time when the ordinary
activities of vehicle painting are practically at a standstill, the cutter
and sleigh painting business furnishes a medium for profits gleefully taken
advantage of by the average factory and jobbing shop painter.</p>

<p>In one way, it must be confessed, this branch of painting has fallen off
in attractiveness. The elaborate decorative effects once so largely in the full
favor of fashion have been discarded, and many workmen competent to accomplish
such effects have become lost in other pursuits. But in these days
the painter should be prepared for any emergency; hence it is best that cutter
and sleigh decorative work be given study, and skill to execute such work
be kept in hand or acquired by practice. Now and then comes a call for a
cutter or sleigh ornamented in the old-fashioned way with elaborate arm
pieces, etc. The jobbing shop painter especially is very frequently confronted
with opportunities for the practice of decorative painting in a variety of
ways, and to fulfill his mission as an important community artisan he should
be prepared to do the work. The very low prices paid for cutter and sleigh
painting at the present time have proved an effective factor, no doubt, in
considerably restricting the limitations of decorative painting. At the same
time, there is every reason to believe that the conspicuous absence of fine
decorative effects in cutter and sleigh painting is also due, to a large extent,
to the inability of the average latter-day workman, located in provincial
centres, to fittingly produce them. Upon the modern Portland style cutter
elaborate ornamentation would perhaps be out of place; but upon many of
the runner vehicles of ancient and honorable vintage, which the beauteous
Belle of Fashion has decreed to be the proper thing, a generous measure of
decorative work would be appropriate. Swell sleighs of more recent pattern
take kindly to lavish ornamentation built upon rather delicate lines.</p>

<p>These conditions, therefore, warrant the painter who deeply desires to
command profits and success in cutter and sleigh painting, in cultivating a
ready skill and dexterity along the lines of ornamental work.</p>

<p>Surface perfections have grown to be important considerations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
economy of sleigh painting of
the best grade. While none
but the very finest class of
cutters and sleighs are given
surfaces rivalling in smoothness
and quality those reflected
by the best class of carriages,
still, first-class surfacing
remains a chief feature of
sleigh painting, excepting at
all times the seven-for-$100
vehicles. And in respect to
this latter class of jobs, the
results achieved in the way of
surface effects are often surprising,
due chiefly to the very
heavy coats of varnish applied.</p>

<p>And here the reader may
deem it pertinent to ask for a review of the systems and methods practiced
in painting and finishing cutters and sleighs.</p>

<div id="Fig_15_02" class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i_b_140b.jpg" width="275" height="271" alt="Pencil Sketch for Panel Corner" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the painting of runner vehicles of the best order the jobs are primed
throughout, bodies and running parts (and this includes inside of bodies,
under surface&mdash;everything, in fact, not covered with iron), with oil and lead
primer. Permitting this coat to dry thoroughly, a light sanding with, say
No. <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> sandpaper, is given, and then a coat of lead containing enough raw
linseed oil to bind the pigment securely without giving it a gloss is put on.
Use an oval or round bristle brush to apply the lead to the body, and for the
running parts use a camel's-hair brush, this latter tool being best adapted to
lay a uniform depth of pigment over the sharp edges and small surfaces of
the running parts. Upon this coat
putty both body and running parts
draw-puttying all open-grained portions
of the surface. Forty-eight
hours after puttying begin rough-stuffing
the body, using for the 'stuff equal
parts of any good American filler and
keg lead, by weight, reducing to a
thick paste in equal parts of quick
rubbing varnish and japan, then cutting
to a brushing consistency with
turpentine. This is a two-coat-per-day
'stuff. Apply four coats of the 'stuff,
then a guide coat of yellow ochre and
set aside for a few days. After rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the surface out (full instructions for
rubbing roughstuff may be found in <a href="#Chapter_03">Chapter III</a>.
of this series) give it plenty of
time&mdash;twelve or fourteen hours at least&mdash;to
dry out. Then lightly sandpaper with
No. 0 paper, dust off, and give first coat of
color.</p>

<div id="Fig_15_03" class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_141a.jpg" width="250" height="246" alt="Pencil Sketch for Panel Corner" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The proper color foundation being secured,
apply two coats of rubbing varnish,
either both clear or one clear and one color-and-varnish,
the character of the color
foundation determining the selection, and
then follow with a heavily flowed on coat
of finishing varnish. In case color-and-varnish be used, the striping and
ornamental work had best be done on this coat, as upon work of this
quality the ornamentation will require the protection of a rubbing, as well
as a finishing, coat of varnish.</p>

<p>The running parts require sandpapering, then one coat of color-and-varnish,
then striping and finishing. This system, intended exclusively for
high class work, requires a very thorough carrying out, with no neglected
details from priming coat to finishing, if a satisfactory degree of excellence,
both in finish and durability, would be maintained.</p>

<p>Another system, in which roughstuff does not figure, consists of giving
body and gear, when received from the wood shop, a coat of lead, ochre, and
oil priming. When the irons are attached, the job is sandpapered and a
coat of lead containing a durable binder of oil is given. The wood and iron
are alike coated with this mixture. The panels of the body are next, in due
season, plastered with putty (see Knifing Head Formula No. 1, in <a href="#Chapter_03">Chapter III</a>.),
the pigment being firmly forced into the grain of the wood. Aim to get
a very smooth application of the pigment in addition to a complete fullness of
the wood pores, to the end that the surface cells may be sealed "against graining
out" and that the labor of sandpapering may be reduced to the minimum.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The first coat of color is furnished with a binder of oil and should not be
recoated until the day following. Add varnish as a binder for the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
coat of color. A single coat of rubbing, and one of some hard drying finishing
varnish often suffices to complete the finish. If a better job is desired an
extra coat of rubbing is given. The striping, corner pieces, etc., are done on
the flat color. The running parts are puttied on the priming coat, exposed
parts of open grained surface draw-puttied, sandpapered, given one coat of
color, coat of color-and-varnish, striped, and finished with a heavy bodied,
hard drying finishing varnish. Again, for medium priced sleigh work a
factory system consists of applying some reliable liquid wood filler to the job
throughout, then a little later wiping the surface over with soft, clean rags.
The work is allowed twenty-four hours in which to dry out, when the body
is given a coat of roughstuff mixed in the proportion of 3 lbs. of filler to 1 lb.
of keg lead, equal parts of japan and rubbing varnish being used to reduce
it to a heavy paste, and turpentine employed to cut it to the proper working
consistency. Putty on this coat of 'stuff. Then apply, at the rate of two
coats per day, a roughstuff made according to the first formula given herewith.
Three coats of this stuff should suffice. Rub out with rubbing bricks,
color and finish out as previously advised. The running parts are puttied
upon the filler coat, draw puttied wherever needed, then colored, given color-and-varnish,
striped and finished.</p>

<p>In some shops the roughstuff is discarded altogether, the wood filler being
filled over with a couple of lead coats, the first coat containing an oil
binder and the second one containing no oil at all. This lead foundation is
surfaced down with sandpaper, dusted off, and a wash of quick hard drying
rubbing varnish, thinned down about one-half with turpentine, given. The
surface is then finished out in the usual way. The running parts are treated
as described in the liquid wood filler process previously given.</p>

</div>

<p>The anti-kalsomine system concerning which considerable discussion
was had somewhat recently amounts to this: The jobs are primed throughout
with oil, yellow ochre, and perhaps a little lead. The bodies are then
taken in hand and all necessary puttying done. The anti-kalsomine, the
fixer or binder of which is cement, is next mixed to a working consistency
with hot water and applied hot. It is best to
allow the first coat of kalsomine to stand over
night before being recoated, although in the factory
system three or four coats of the cement,
<em>always applied hot</em>, are put on per day. Then a
liquid mixture of oil, japan, and turpentine, in
the proportion of two parts of oil to three parts of
japan, and one part of turpentine, is flowed over
the kalsomine foundation. This liquid wash
serves to weld or amalgamate the cement with
the priming coat. The sandpapering of these
anti-kalsomine foundations is one of the principal
draw-backs to the use of the cement. It sets in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
motion flotillas of dust, stifling and suffocating to an extreme. It has been
noted, however, that this anti-kalsomine treatment has furnished some fine
wearing and very durable surfaces.</p>

<p>The carriage painter in practicing his trade as it applies exclusively to
carriages is confined to a comparatively few colors, but in devoting his
skill to cutter and sleigh work an extended variety of colors may be used.
Artistic instincts are in good demand in the cutter and sleigh painting business.
Possibilities for the harmonious combination of colors exist here to
an extent not known of in the other branches of painting. Colors sombre
and gay; emblematic of this, that, or the other thing; old-fashioned as the
days of witch burning or as modern and up-to-date as the '97 color grinder
can make them, are all alike acceptable in the sight of the people who love a
sleigh ride. Some painters have a great liking for siennas and umbers as
body colors for sleigh work. Toned down some they do gleam very showily
under varnish. Such colors striped with aluminum or gold and edged with
a fine line of red give a strikingly handsome effect, especially if the running
parts are painted in some one of the beautiful light reds at present
available; or a lighter shade of the body color can be advantageously employed
upon the running parts. Perhaps the lighter styles of cutters,
speeding cutters, for example, take more kindly to the light and showy reds
as running-parts colors than do the vehicles of heavier build, but all styles,
nevertheless, permit of brilliant color effects in the treatment of running
parts. For a light track or speeding cutter, color the side and back panels
medium ultramarine blue; the dash, carmine; running parts, a very light
carmine. Stripe the panels, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch line of gold with a fine line of carmine.
The dash and running parts may be displayed with striping of black and
gold. Portland cutters for ordinary service show handsomely with the body
panels done in ultramarine blue, moldings blacked, with the running parts
done in the lightest shades of the ultramarine blue, the job then striped
throughout with a primrose yellow stripe. Or again, these cutters are
painted deep carmine throughout the body, with light carmine running
parts. The striping on body consists of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> inch line of
black, and <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> inch inside of that is flashed a fine gold line. A
Portland amber color for the body, with a lighter shade of the
same color for the running-parts, looks fetching, notably so when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the body panels are striped with double lines of carmine, the ornamental
corner pieces being done in carmine of a lighter shade. The running
parts may get a single <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> inch line of carmine. Then one can see in the
cutter and sleigh centres Portlands done in ashen-grey, canary and lemon
yellow, etc.</p>

<p>One of the largest cutter and sleigh factories in this country has this
year abandoned the double fine line style of striping so greatly in evidence
for several years past, using instead, as a rule, a <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>-inch carmine stripe&mdash;obtained
by glazing carmine over a yellow base&mdash;with a distance fine line of
gold running inside of it. At this establishment one can see a jaunty Portland
painted pure white, with the body striped a <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>-inch blue line with a
distance fine line of red. Here also are to be seen beautiful amber browns,
charming greens, elegant yellows of the primrose, orange, canary order and
extending down to the delicate cream colors. But, on the whole, those cutter
and sleigh builders and painters who cater to the worshipers at Fashion's
shrine show a determination to adhere to the dark rich colors, such as
browns, greens, and blacks, for panel work. Cutters with running parts
painted in colors different from those used upon the bodies are not so much
in evidence as formerly. Where the dark colors promise to remain in high
favor with a large class of the very exclusive folk for some years to come, no
strict adherence to such colors may be expected on the part of the general
cutter-and-sleigh-using public.</p>


<h3>STRIPING, CORNER PIECES, SCROLLS, ETC.</h3>

<p>In the striping of cutters and sleighs the real basis of success is a judicious
selection of colors. It has been a common saying in factory circles that
anything in the way of colors, hit or miss, goes in sleigh painting when the
ornamenting is reached. But this should not be so; in point of fact, it is not
so in those establishments doing a good class of work. A riotous jumble of
colors thrown into a fine line corner piece or scroll is an abominable exhibition
of bad taste. There is nothing, we dare say, that so completely stamps
the cheap cutter or sleigh with a glaring badge of cheapness as the ornament
constructed from an inharmonious selection of colors and dotted to beat a
Baxter St. vest lining. The dotter has no business striping or ornamenting
the modern cutter or sleigh. The ornamental features of sleigh work need to
be of a very high order of excellence. Otherwise it fails to correspond to the
quality of finish which now obtains in all first-class establishments where
sleigh work is carried on. In this connection the reader's attention is directed
to examples of fine line ornaments adapted to Portland cutters and sleighs;
also to examples of the bold, handsome relief scrolls once so extensively
used, and which show so beautifully upon cutters and sleighs of the swell
body pattern.</p>

<p>Ornaments Nos. <a href="#Fig_15_01">1</a>, <a href="#Fig_15_02">2</a>, and <a href="#Fig_15_03">3</a> are quick pencil sketches for panel corners.
The writer contributed these pieces to <cite>The Hub</cite> some time ago and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
reproduction must be credited to the courtesy of that journal. <a href="#Fig_15_04">No. 4</a> is used
upon the dashes of Portland cutters, speeding sleighs, etc. Two distinct
corner pieces are shown in this design, thus illustrating the possibilities of
variation in respect to the corner designs employed. <a href="#Fig_15_05">No. 5</a> is a corner piece
designed for Old Comfort and Empress cutters. This piece may be done in
three or four shades of red, or it may be placed in gold and high lighted in
relief style. In <a href="#Fig_15_06">No. 6</a> is to be seen a very attractive design for the dash or
rear panel of a large four or six passenger sleigh. <a href="#Fig_15_07">No. 7</a> is expressly intended
for swell body cutters and represents an ornament familiar to many
old-time painters. It is a decidedly effective scroll and will afford the student
in scroll work a good working plan for further effort. Nos. <a href="#Fig_15_08">8</a> and <a href="#Fig_15_09">9</a> explain
the style of the good-old fashioned scrolls which, when ably executed, may
be declared the poetry of ornament. Vehicle painting lost one of its chief
charms when the relief scroll was abandoned, and we say speed the day when
it is welcomed back to its old time uses and prestige. Then fortunate indeed
will be the painter who is able to do relief scrolling.</p>

<p>Transfer ornaments of the small patterns are still used and they really
furnish happy little surface beautifiers at small cost. One can quickly master
the work of successfully applying transfers or "Decalcomanie," as our friends
of the genteel speech may say. Cut the transfer down close to its true outlines,
and then to the back of the ornament apply a size of finishing varnish
and japan gold size. When this has reached the right "tack," it is placed
in position on the surface. It is then given a few minutes to fasten itself securely
upon the surface, after which it is washed over with clean water until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the covering over the face of the transfer is sufficiently moistened to free
itself, when lo! the ornament in all its freshness and coloring of raiment is
revealed. The washing of the transfer is something of a delicate operation
as it is a perfectly easy matter to disfigure the ornament or flood it out of
position by careless practices.</p>

<h3>REPAINTING CUTTERS AND SLEIGHS, REVARNISHING, ETC.</h3>

<p>Cutters and sleighs for repainting, revarnishing and brightening up generally
should be got into the paint shop as soon as possible after the carriage
work declines in the late fall. This enables the painter to avoid the rush
which is sure to be upon him with the first "run of sleighing." It also enables
him to do more satisfactory work in several ways. The work taken in early
has a measure of time given it while being carried through the several processes
not accorded that received late in the season. Varnish coats given
proper time to dry not only surface up better but wear and retain their brilliancy
longer, and do not fire crack when run out in the cold. Upon the
average class of cutters and sleighs a less expensive varnish, as compared to
that used upon first-class carriages, will serve all necessary purposes. Expensive
finishing varnishes are not needed. Cutters and sleighs are not
exposed to the severe and destructive forms of service that wheeled vehicles
are, consequently they do not require highly elastic finishing varnishes to
furnish the needed durability. They are in service for only a comparatively
small part of the year, and mud spotting and troubles of that order do not
intrude themselves. Save in the case of the highest-class sleigh work, a first-class
gear finishing varnish will furnish satisfactory results for finishing cutter
and sleigh bodies. A heavy gear varnish will answer perfectly for the
running parts. But in this selection of varnishes choice should always fall
upon those of first-class quality. Whatever the grade, get the best in quality
of that grade. First-class paint and varnish stock is more handily worked
and will cover more surface than inferior stock, and judged from any point of
view one may elect it is the most economical material to buy.</p>

<p>When a cutter or sleigh comes in for a thorough repainting, examine
the vehicle closely and if the body can be removed without too large an
expenditure of labor, removal should be insisted upon. There is usually
considerable dirt under the edges of a cutter body that cannot be cleaned out
except the body be taken off. And a little of this dirt caught up in the paint
or varnish brush worketh evil to the whole job. Moreover, the brushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
brought in contact with such accumulations of dirt are unfitted to produce
pleasing results in the immediate future. The touch-up-and-varnish sleigh
job is, in the main, a troublesome affair, especially the running parts. The
merry and pretty colors which chiefly obtain on sleigh running parts painted
in former years are not so easily matched as the colors used upon the bodies.
In point of fact, it doesn't pay to devote much time in trying for a match.
Instead, mix a color to about the shade of the old color and go over the running
parts entire. Then restripe and finish, and in the great majority of cases
money will be saved thereby. In rubbing cutter or sleigh work furnished
with heavy moldings out of varnish, use, for surfacing such moldings, any
varnish brush of a small pattern worn to a stub. Cutting through on the
edges of the moldings is nicely avoided in this way. For the large panels on
sleigh work a 3-inch finishing brush will serve as the best tool. It carries a
greater quantity of varnish and enables the finisher to coat the surface
quicker than he could do with the smaller brush. In finishing the quick and
adroit placing of the varnish is an item of chief importance.</p>

<p>During the sleigh season there usually drifts into the jobbing paint shop
a lot of not very particular work. As for example, heavy work, sleighs,
bobs, etc. Upon such work there may be used the accumulated odds and
ends of colors of various shades, hues, and tints, left over from doing sleigh
work of a better class and from carriage work. Some very neat combinations
may be effected by the judicious employment of these left-over bits of
color, and it helps to slick up and put into profitable use certain materials
which otherwise might eventually find their way into that quagmire of the
paint shop&mdash;the slush keg. Briefly stated, cutter and sleigh painting opens
the way for the employment of considerable material which cannot be termed
strictly "available" in the other branches of painting; it comes at a time
when the painter is better able to appreciate a lean loaf than a fat icicle; and
if conducted according to business-like and workman-like practices it will
supply a handsome source of profits.</p>

<p class="dropcap">At best the carriage painter's existence is somewhat hazardous, his
every-day scene of toil being well laden with poisonous fumes and
fetid exhalations. In the painting of a hearse, ambulance, or "dead
wagon" the precaution of disinfecting the vehicle most thoroughly should
be taken. Carbolic acid, carbonate of lime, or, if one prefers, numerous
ready prepared disinfectants of penetrating composition may be used generously.
Prudence dictates the policy of refusing to take any chances when
working in and about a vehicle possibly afflicted with the germs of some
deadly contagious disease.</p>

<p>It is not always an easy matter to clean the glasses in heavy coach work
unless special methods are practiced. Here is a quick way of cleaning besmeared
glasses of the kind named. Saturate a soft sponge with wood alcohol
and wipe over both sides of the glass. If perchance varnish or paint
accumulations are in evidence the alcohol softens them and a quick runaround
with a keen-edged putty knife removes them. If a careless or incompetent
workman has badly bedaubed a glass, coat the daubs with oxalic acid.
The action of this powerful liquid will very briefly soften up the accumulations
so that the putty knife will nicely slick them off. Then give a rub over
with an alcohol-charged sponge, this to be immediately followed by a smart
polish with the chamois skin. If a still better polish is desired, take a newspaper,
roll it into a shape that will permit rubbing the glass without
bringing the fingers in contact with the surface, and then dipping the paper
into dry lampblack proceed to burnish both sides of the glass.</p>

<p>The blending of colors has lately become an important feature of the
carriage painter's art. This was at one time considered purely a matter of
business belonging to the artist, but it is not now so regarded. Artistic, and
therefore harmonious, color blending consists in preserving the individuality
of each color employed, while at the same time there is an almost unconscious
merging of one color into another. No distinctive lines are allowed to disturb
the harmony of the work. The carriage color blender, like his brother
artist of the palette and three-story studio, aims to obtain a thorough incorporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of all the different shades of color employed upon a certain piece of
work so that the blending from light lo dark may be made without resorting
to any glaring contrasts. The blending is accomplished while the colors are
wet, the ground being laid first in the lighter colors, then working in the
darker shades until the darkest desired shade is reached. Great care is necessarily
expended upon the tools, etc. A color-clogged brush need not be
expected to do good blending service. No arbitrary rules can be given within
which to confine the work of blending&mdash;it is too closely allied to art for that.
Supremely necessary aids to success in this field of work consist of plenty of
practice taken in connection with intelligent study of outline, harmony, and
contrasts.</p>

<p>If it is desirable to varnish a job of gilding the same day the leaf is laid,
and it is feared that the leaf will brush mark, it is a good plan to give the
gold a light coat of thin shellac, going over the work very quickly. The
shellac will protect the leaf without in any way harming it.</p>

<p>One hears a good deal concerning spontaneous combustion. The craft
would be less familiar with the term if the following rule, rigidly enforced in
some shops, were lived up to in letter and spirit: <em>Greasy rags must be burned
up immediately, and not, under any consideration, allowed to remain in the
shop one moment after their use is finished. Any violation of this order will result
in immediate dismissal.</em></p>

<p>The following method of filling in a badly cracked carriage surface has
successfully been practiced by a friend of the writer's. The surface is first
cleaned and given a light sandpapering to strike off dirt, motes, etc. Then
dust off and apply a coat of gold-size japan, a free, generous coat of the japan
being used. Once dry, the coat is gone over with a roll of rubbing felt to
kill the gloss. The gold-size japan reaches into the minute orifices more effectively
than varnish, filling and sealing the fissures, and in addition it furnishes
an easily and quickly prepared surface for the color and the varnish
coats to follow.</p>

<p>You wish to repair a split panel. At each extremity of the split bore a
<span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch hole. Put one hole just at the crack, the second one fairly clear of
it. Next plug the holes up, and then dress off even with the surface of the
panel. Now cut a shallow bevel along each side of the crack; this to enable
the putty to resist the cracking tendency of the crevice. Then give
the dressed off parts a coat of lead containing a good binder of oil. When this
has dried putty the hollow level and fill with a putty made of <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> dry white
lead and <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> keg lead, the liquids being rubbing varnish and japan, equal
parts. Sandpaper this repair in due time, and then give the final puttying,
which should be done to the full measure of the best possible skill.</p>

<p>An effective little advertising card was once circulated by a keen-minded
California carriage painter, and on the back of the card were appended the
following wise admonitions to the carriage user. The suggestions are quite
as pertinent now as they were at the time they were first given publicity. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
insure durability of the painting you must care for the work as follows, viz:</p>

<p>
"Don't expose to the fumes of ammonia.<br />
Don't let mud dry on it.<br />
Don't scratch the varnish in washing.<br />
Don't expose to the sun or rain when not in use.<br />
Don't let the axle-grease collect on the hubs.<br />
Don't blame me if you are careless, as I have given you warning."<br />
</p>

<p>A man is well dressed only when every part of his apparel meets the
approval of the critic. This same estimate also applies to carriage painting&mdash;that
is to genteel carriage painting. Hence why send the top joints on a carriage
top out roughly and incompletely finished? The critical eye rests very
quickly upon such conspicuous parts of a vehicle, and if they are not fittingly
finished the seal of condemnation is set upon the work as a whole. Here
is a finish for top joints that will disarm the fault finder: First coat up with
stout coat of lead containing sufficient oil to bind the lead securely. Then
mix two parts dry white lead, one part roughstuff filler, to a rather stiff paste
in equal parts of japan and rubbing varnish. Rub this mixture onto the
joints with a piece of heavy harness leather. When dry, give the pigment a
thorough smoothing up with sandpaper, color, color-and-varnish, rub with
water and pumice stone, and then finish with a hard drying finishing varnish.</p>

<p>To paint a carriage gear in silver bronze, which one is now and then
asked to do, bring the work up to the point of the foundation color for the
bronze very carefully, using no lampblack in the priming and first lead coats
to throw them to a slate color. The foundation coat should be pure white,
mixed to dry without gloss and applied with a camel's-hair brush. Over this
coat flow on a coat of rubbing varnish, and when the right "tack" is reached
apply the bronze with a soft, clean camel's-hair brush. The wiping off and
the delicate burnish may be given with a soft piece of chamois skin. Stripe
with some color that harmonizes nicely with the bronze, and use no varnish
over it. Varnish destroys the richness of the bronze.</p>

<p>Why use a broad pencil in glazing double line stripes? The existing
space between the stripes, when the glazing is done with a broad pencil, reflects
a clouded, muddy appearance. Better glaze each line separately, using
a sword pencil for glazing with, and thus obtain the best color effects along
with a fine, dressy outline of striping.</p>

<p>If a carriage top from which the enamel has nearly or quite vanished is
desired to be made bright again the following recipe, published by the writer
in <cite>Painting and Decorating</cite> some time since, will give satisfaction: Mix 2
parts of liquid glue with 3 parts of dissolved castile soap, adding 120 parts
of soft water, to more thoroughly liquify the glue and soap. Then add 4
parts of spirit varnish, after which stir in 2 parts of wheat starch, previously
mixed in water. Follow with just enough lampblack to give the mixture a
solidly black tinge. A trifle too much of the lampblack will kill the gloss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
The dressing is now ready for use. It should be kept in an air-tight vessel
to prevent thickening.</p>

<p>A green stripe is strikingly enriched by glazing with verdigris, but this
glaze should be varnished over as soon as dry, or, at any rate, before moisture
settles upon the work; otherwise the verdigris will lose its quality.</p>

<p>It's a very simple operation to sweep a varnish or paint-room floor, but
some ways are better than others, nevertheless. Try this way for a change
and thereby establish its utility: Take a pail of sawdust, dampen it thoroughly,
and then throw a windrow of the woody bits across one side of the
room. Sweep across to the other side of the apartment, and then observe
how spick and clean the floor will be, with no moisture remaining to annoy
the painter or varnisher.</p>

<p>The blow-pipe should be more in evidence in the carriage paint shop.
The tinsmith will charge but a small fee for making the pipe, which may be
<span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> ft. long and tapering from <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> inch at one end to <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> inch at the other.
Dust and dirt that cannot be removed with a duster is simply given a cyclone
breath through the tube, and, presto! the parts are clean. With the blow-pipe
water can be driven out of evasive corners when cleaning up a job preparatory
to varnishing.</p>

<p>Despite the best laid plans of the painter carriage linings occasionally
get some glaring smears of pigment. If the linings so defaced be of light
color, dampen with naphtha or gasoline, and then with a clean woolen cloth
rub the goods briskly. This same treatment may be given to dark colored
cloth upon which the paint spots have dried. If the spots are observed while
the paint is still wet, rub them smartly with pieces of the same kind of cloth
of which the lining is composed. The cloth to cloth treatment is a most effective
and easy treatment.</p>

<p>The business wagon painter has many moldings and battens to black,
and he greatly needs a good, pleasant handling pencil with which to do the
work. A pretty working pencil for doing the parts here named is made in
this wise: Take some hair from a camel's-hair pencil and mix with it <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>
black sable hair. Prepare a handle as though you were to make a sword
pencil, splitting it at the base, etc. Then, after arranging the hair to the
right width and thickness, insert the butt end of the bunch in the split.
Wind tightly with strong linen thread. Use on the flat side of the pencil
instead of the edge.</p>

<p>An imitation-of-ebony job comes within the province of the painter's
skill now and then. First of all, the wood should be close, fine-grained stuff.
Wash it with a decoction of logwood three or four times, allowing the liquid
to dry well between applications. Next wash with a solution of acetate of
iron. This gives a deep, intensely black color.</p>

<p>For the filling of an unusually deep surface cavity prepare a pigment
after this formula: One part keg lead; 2 parts whiting. Mix to a stiff paste in
equal parts of thick varnish bottoms and raw linseed oil. Add a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
quantity of japan to insure reliable drying. Then to this mass mix in
enough dry white lead to cause the putty to work nicely from the hand.
Apply very smooth so as to avoid sandpapering.</p>

<p>One of the secrets of the French coach painter's success as a fine varnisher
and finisher was revealed by W. H. Knight's report on the Paris Exposition.
Referring to the varnish room, Mr. Knight wrote: The door is
locked, and no one is admitted under any circumstances&mdash;not even the proprietor.
The doors and windows are air-tight, so that not a particle of dust
can find entrance. And yet the room is ventilated, but how? By means of
tubes filled with a mixture of horsehair and wool. This permits the air to
enter freely, but deprives it of all dust, consequently the finish of their work
is perfect and exquisite.</p>

<p>All surfaces painted with lake colors should be amply protected by substantial
varnish coats. Neither the lake coats nor the foundations over which
they are laid should be allowed to dry "dead." Give the ground coats a bit
of gloss and <em>always</em> use the lakes as color-and-varnish coats. Also, <em>always</em>
refrain from buying a cheap, inferior lake, the chief constituents of which are
whiting and aniline dye. Water dissolves the aniline: hence with water as an
aid the painter can determine the quality, in a measure at least, of the lake
colors. To the surface painted in a lake color, apply, before coating with
varnish, a generous smear of water. If the aniline speedily disappears, leaving
the colorless whiting base, the purchaser has just cause to question the
quality of the material.</p>

<p>A varnish sag upon a surface doesn't always admit of easy removal. It
can be done, however, and that very quickly and smoothly in a majority of
cases. Get a stocky bunch of curled hair, wet it up thoroughly, give it a
liberal dip in pulverized pumice stone, and then rub the afflicted surface
carefully. Finish with a uniform polish furnished by the regular varnish
surfacing equipment.</p>

<p>Carriage and wagon interiors, running parts, etc., finished in the natural
wood, that have become stained in spots so as to be an offense to the
eye, may be satisfactorily renewed by smearing the stains with oxalic acid.
Apply the acid with a brush, permit it to act upon the stains for a few minutes,
then with a small sponge wash off with clean, soft water. The steel
scraper, handily wielded, will then remove all remaining evidences of the
stains. All metallic surfaces may be perfectly cleaned with this acid.</p>

<p>The question of carriage springs rusting is a live one with the carriage
painter. The spring maker, or rather the first-class manufacturer of springs,
avers that the spring product well ground and finished is not at all liable to
rust or prematurely throw off its protecting coats of paint and varnish. The
carriage painter, however, is compelled to paint and dress up all sorts and
conditions of springs. The badly rusted and scaly springs may be thoroughly
cleaned, using a file and hammer for the purpose, and the spring layers being
separated one from another. Then coat with graphite paint or mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
brown, and in due time finish up in the usual way. Again, the inner surface
of the spring leaves is coated with a lead and lampblack mixture, and later
given a glazing of equal parts of unsalted beef and mutton tallow. A third
formula, widely known as <cite>The Hub</cite> formula, because it is said to have originated
with that journal, has proven of value. It is as follows: "Remove the
securing bolts; place the springs thus released from tension in a bath of soft
water over night. In the morning, with a stiff bristle or helix brush, in
water at 100° degrees, scour the plates effectually, and remove the oxide by
means of an ample use of elbow grease. Dry by sunlight or artificial heat
in hardwood sawdust. Let lie in warm sawdust, at 75° or 80° for from two to
three hours; then give a thin coat of clear, boiled linseed oil, and when thoroughly
dry (an exposure of twelve or more hours is necessary), coat over by
means of a sponge with a mixture of 6 parts of commercial beeswax, suspended
at 90°, with 2 parts of spirits of turpentine. One hour after application
wipe off edges of all plates; then allow one hour for hardening and
secure the plate with centre bolt."</p>

<p>The carriage painter frequently has sign writing to do on glass and he
requires a reliable size to enable him to get first-class leafing. Russian isinglass
makes the best size, although it is often difficult to obtain from local
merchants. To a pint of soft water add a piece of the isinglass <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> in. square
and boil until the material is wholly dissolved. Then add a drop or two of
alcohol, strain, and the size is ready for use. Gelatine, while largely used,
should be used the day it is prepared as a size, otherwise it is not reliable in
its action. Put a few shreds of the gelatine in a quart of water and boil
until the water is reduced to a pint.</p>

<p>Vermilion is one of the highly-prized carriage painting pigments, and the
best is none too good to meet the requirements of good work. To test the
color, heat a small quantity in a porcelain vessel over an alcohol lamp. The
adulterated vermilion, in burning, will leave a sediment either red, black, or
perhaps white. The genuine quicksilver vermilion invariably proves fugitive
when submitted to intense heat.</p>

<p>The refuse oil of pine or coal tar is a useful oil to keep upon the paint
shop shelves. Suppose a borrowed brush or a brush neglected in some way
about the shop is found dried up&mdash;hardened to a stone-like condition. Take
a quantity of the pine or coal tar oil from its air-tight receptacle, where it
should be kept to prevent evaporation, and in the liquid suspend the injured
brush well up over the bristles. Three or four days' immersion will usually
soften up a very much abused brush.</p>

<p>All colors that are apparently changed in purity of color when even the
palest of varnishes are used over them, should have a little of the color used
in each varnish coat up to the finishing coat of varnish. If striping or ornamenting
is used do this work upon the last rubbing coat and then finish with
the very palest varnish obtainable.</p>

<p>Bear in mind this fact, namely: Colors are divided into three cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
degrees&mdash;light, medium, and dark. And the relative position of the base
color governs the intermediate shades. In the mixing and use of colors it is
also a wise policy to provide for the self-asserting property of the strongest
or controlling color. If this is not done the distinctive character of the color
sought for will not for long be retained.</p>

<p>A prime factor in finishing a carriage in natural wood consists in first
thoroughly cleaning the wood and then keeping it clean. All stains and discolorations
of the wood should be sandpapered out or scraped off with steel
scraper and a piece of glass. Then a careful, uniform sandpapering should
be given. Dust off and apply a coat of raw linseed oil. This oil coat requires
a clean, smooth rubbing out&mdash;as clean and smooth as a coat of paint.
Give this oil coat from 24 to 36 hours to dry and harden completely. Sandpaper
lightly, dust off, and give the surface a coating of some reliable, first-class,
wood filler. As soon as the filler takes on a sufficient "tack," rub
across the grain of the wood with soft, clean rags until the surface is free
from any surplus filler. If, after the application of the filler, the cells of the
wood remain unfilled or defectively sealed, a second coat of the filler will be
necessary. Once the filler has dried, mix a putty colored to match the natural
color of the wood, and putty nail and screw holes and other cavities.
This puttying should be done so smoothly as to necessitate little or no sandpapering
for the purpose of leveling the putty spots. The whole surface may
now in due time be lightly gone over with No. 0 paper. Next dust off and
apply a coat of pale rubbing varnish. The striping is best done on this coat.
Then give second coat of rubbing, surfacing this coat, when dry, with pulverized
pumice stone and water, clean up most thoroughly, and finish with a
very pale durable finishing varnish.</p>

<p>The painting of one of these natural-wood-finished jobs often presents a
formidable problem. What is the best method to pursue? That cannot be
answered decisively; but a reliable method is appended. First scrape and
sandpaper the old varnish clean and sleek to the wood. If the wood is in
good shape and not weather-beaten, apply a coat of lead containing no more
oil than is carried in the keg lead as it comes from the dealer, the pigment
being simply thinned with turpentine and given a drying agent in the shape
of a teaspoonful of coach japan, to, say, each pint of the mixture. If the
varnish has perished, and the wood is injured thereby, it is advisable to give
the lead a little extra dash of oil, but not enough to cause the lead to dry
with a gloss. Testing the lead on the finger nail will determine the question
of gloss. When dry this coating of lead should receive a careful sandpapering,
and a second coat of lead mixed to dry "dead," and laid with a camel's-hair
brush, may go on. Too much oil should be especially avoided in building
the lead foundation over these natural wood surfaces, as it must be borne in
mind that the grain of the wood has been already sealed with a hard, non-absorbent
material into which the usual first coat percentage of oil does not
penetrate. On this second coat of lead all needed puttying is done. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
sandpapering which follows should be very perfect and skillfully done. Body
surfaces may next receive the needed roughstuff coating up, to be subsequently
rubbed out and carried through to a finish in the ordinary way. The
running parts from this lead coat foundation are colored and finished according
to the accepted practice.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, my lamented friend, A. F. Manchester, in the columns
of <cite>Varnish</cite>, asked this pertinent question: "Do you have trouble
with your fine colors clouding up and losing their brilliancy from the varnish?"
Replying to the query, he suggested this plan, to the efficacy of
which the writer is glad to subscribe: "On any transparent color (or any
color, in fact) always add some of the color to each coat of rubbing varnish&mdash;enough
to kill the amber tint of the varnish. This preserves the colors in
all their original brilliancy. Of course, this plan necessitates striping and
ornamenting on the last coat of rubbing, but that is just as well as burying
all the tone of the colors under the varnish. Then, again, it obliges the customer
to have the job revarnished when he ought."</p>

<p>It is not a praiseworthy practice to putty a carriage body after it is
rubbed out of roughstuff, or after the first coat of color is on. The puttying
should be attended to when the job is being roughstuffed&mdash;and before. All
places overlooked at the first puttying should be attended to carefully upon
the first coat of roughstuff. Puttying upon a roughstuffed rubbed panel
leads to premature surface blemishes of a most unhappy order.</p>

<p>Certain of the yellows are rather difficult to work nicely when used as
striping colors for dagger or sword pencils. Notably so is chrome yellow,
which, by the way, is a pretty foundation for glazing with carmine. Such
colors may be remedied by adding a bit of some body color which will give
them a stronger covering property without harmfully changing the purity
of the yellow.</p>

<p>The subject of varnish rooms is an entertaining one. So many poor
varnish rooms exist that any plan to make them better, so long as it be a
feasible plan, merits attention. Mr. F. J. Flowers, an old-time carriage man
and an earnest advocate of the first-class varnish room, some time ago gave
his idea of such an apartment in these words: "First, it should not be on the
top floor of a building where it gets all the gases and fumes from the smith
and paint shops. It should be round in form, with a dome roof, ventilated
and well lighted therefrom; and each light of glass should be as colorless as
possible, and arranged so as to prevent the direct rays of the sun. Its ceiling
should be all wood, stained light blue with water colors; the floor should be
waxed or oiled; the room, when in use, should be kept at an even temperature
(not less than 65°), and all dampness should be avoided. You ask, why
round? I answer, all evaporations form in circles when ascending; the room
having no corners, there is no back draught to obstruct them. Why lighted
from the roof? There will be no cross-lights, hence no conflicting light. Why
ceiled with wood? It is dryer than plaster and will absorb the evaporations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
when not coated with oil paint. Why color blue? It is the spring light, and
gives the purest reflection. Why an even temperature? It will prevent the
condensing of the vapor, and thereby prevent it from falling back upon the
varnish, which gives it that bloomy, silky, and pitted look which we hear
so much about."</p>

<p>Upon heavy vehicle work, such as broughams, landaus, etc., the inside
surface of glass frames, pillars, door checks, and the like, quite commonly
go with a polish finish, as it does away with sticking doors, defaced pillars,
and glaring glass frames. The contrast between the polished parts and those
reflecting a high brilliancy of finish is soft and pleasing and a grateful relief
to the eye. The parts referred to, having been brought up to a solid foundation
of rubbing varnish, are given a thorough surfacing with pumice stone
flour and water. Next rub with sweet oil and rotten stone, using a soft
woolen cloth for the polisher. Conclude the operation by rubbing wheat
flour under a clean bit of woolen until the friction generated makes a gloss.
The flour, in addition to its other office, will absorb and clean up the oil.</p>

<p>A very quick drying striping color is frequently demanded&mdash;one that
can be varnished over in an hour after application, or sooner. Mix the pigment
in equal parts of rubbing varnish and coach japan. Then thin to the
proper working consistency with turpentine.</p>

<p>In painting over metallic surfaces, which the carriage and wagon painter
frequently finds it necessary to do, it is essential to first know that such surfaces
are thoroughly clean and free from acids, grease, etc. Give them a rub
over with kerosene or benzine, and then wash with soap and water, concluding
with a generous rinsing off with clean water. If the surface is too
heavily saturated with paint injuring accumulations, give it a wash with
water containing sal soda in the proportion of, say, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> to <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> lb. of the soda
to 5 or 6 quarts of water. A rinsing with clean water will now afford a clean
surface over which to paint. The metallic surface being clean, it remains
for the painter to give it a hard, solid surfacing with No. <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> sandpaper, in
order to develop the necessary minute furrows and scratches to give the pigment
a "bite" or a chance to grip fast. Instead of sandpapering, the practice
holds good in some shops of rubbing the surface with a fire brick as a
means of trenching and channeling it to the required extent.</p>

<p>The vehicle painter located in the small shop and not usually using a
very considerable quantity of varnish daily, should buy his supply of this
material in small cans&mdash;pints and quarts for example. Once a can is opened,
the varnish, through repeated exposure to the air, quickly begins to grow
fatty, and after a time the loss of the turpentine leaves it in an unfit condition
to work satisfactorily over a fine surface. A rubber stopper is the best
kind of a varnish can stopper, because it does not crumble and break into
bits like the cork, and it is the closest possible approach to an air-tight
device.</p>

<p>The painter has but small use for the varnish that has to be thinned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
turpentine in order to give it the proper spreading and flowing property.
The elements of durability and brilliancy of lustre are in great danger of
being greatly impaired, if not quite wholly destroyed, when shop thinning
of varnishes is practiced. To attempt to successfully cut the solidity of varnish
with turpentine added in hit or miss fashion constitutes a direct injury
to this manifestly sensitive and delicate material. Thinning varnish should
be resorted to only when an extremely critical emergency presents itself.</p>

<p>To provide a tight, dust-and-smoke-proof floor for the varnish room,
proceed in this wise: Cut strips of stout wrapping paper to the proper
length to fit lengthwise of the floor. Coat one side of the paper with trimmer's
paste, and then lay the strips on smooth and free from wrinkles. Allow
the second strip to overlap the first one fully 2 inches. Continue overlapping
until the floor is covered. When the first layer or covering has laid
long enough to provide for the complete drying of the paste, lay a second
course of the paper in the same manner, and in due time, if necessary, apply
a third course. Then apply a coat of yellow ochre paint, mixed oil and turpentine,
in the proportion of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> oil to <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> turpentine, with a tablespoonful of
japan added to each pint of the paint. The second coat of ochre may be
mixed in <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> hard drying implement varnish to <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> japan.</p>

<p>Mr. P. C. Hoebel, in <cite>Varnish</cite>, interestingly describes his method of
painting over a cracked and fissured surface, and avers that it has for many
years proven uniformly successful. Mr. Hoebel says: "Instead of sanding
down the old varnish, I skin it off by the use of ammonia and a stiff bladed
putty knife. Then rub down with block rubbing stone and let stand over
night to dry out. Next, a good sandpapering with No. 1 paper; dust thoroughly.
Then apply a mixture composed of 1 part drop black, 1 part keg
lead, and the same amount of dry lampblack. Add a little rubbing varnish.
Thin to a proper working consistency with turpentine. Next day putty-glaze
the entire cracked surface with not too soft putty. Use the regulation
hard drying carriage painter's putty. This putty should dry hard enough
to sand well the following day. The sandpapering of this putty is of the
greatest importance and requires an extra amount of elbow grease. The job
is now ready to receive the proper ground work for its respective color which
is to be."</p>

<p>In wagon painting some exceedingly light and delicate tints are used,
and driers for such tints adapted to the delicacy of coloring are needed. Appended
is a formula for a drier of this kind: Mix 15 parts of sulphate of zinc,
4 parts sugar of lead, and 7 of litharge, with pure linseed oil, and grind the
mixture in a paint mill very fine; then mix 100 parts of paris white to a
dough with 50 parts of white lead and linseed oil. Grind this also very fine
in the mill, then mix all together, grinding once more.</p>

<p>It is possible now and then to remedy a case of pitted varnish in this
manner. The morning after the varnish is applied cover the surface with
clear turpentine. Let the turps gradually soak up and soften the pitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
varnish, adding more turps as required. When the varnish has become sufficiently
softened, mix a little raw linseed oil with the turpentine (the oil
holding the turps in check and preventing it from cutting into the under
coats) and with a soft badger-hair brush proceed to "lift" the afflicted varnish
coat. The varnish once removed, let the surface stand for a few hours,
then give it a light rubbing over with a moistened sponge dipped in finely
pulverized pumice stone. Follow with a thorough washing with clean water
and revarnish.</p>

<p>Color and varnish strainers are a necessity. Cheese cloth, cut into 6-inch
squares, gives a very practical kind of strainer. All colors that have
stood for some time after mixing require straining before being used. And
finishing varnish&mdash;all varnish, in fact, should be strained as the final contents
of the can are approached. Many first-class finishers insist upon
straining all the varnish they use; and cheese cloth serves the purpose of a
good strainer at a low cost.</p>

<p>The best stroke for squaring up varnish has often been discussed at
length, and it seems to be the decision of the leading finishers of the country
that the horizontal stroke is to be preferred to the vertical. To the beginner
the former is probably the most difficult to use, the danger of runs,
sags, etc., seemingly being thereby intensified. The natural flow of varnish,
as the finishers all may know, is downward, and the horizontal stroke of the
brush does not arrest this flow or divert it from its accepted course. The
vertical stroke, however, permits of a varnish flow in at least two directions&mdash;sideways
and downward. Runs and other surface defacers are equally
possible with the horizontal or vertical brush stroke. Immunity from such
disturbers depends altogether upon the uniformity and equality with which
the varnish has been flowed upon the surface.</p>

<p>To renovate and give a fresh new look to cushions and backs, when
faded, thin the desired color down with turpentine until it can almost be
called a wash, and apply the mixture very thinly. Allow the color to dry
thoroughly, and then thin shellac with alcohol until a very thin shellac is
provided and coat the articles with this, following immediately with a smart
polishing with neatsfoot oil and then wiping dry with clean woolen cloths.</p>

<p>The twine used for bridling paint brushes&mdash;and the twine bridle is the
favored kind in the carriage paint shop&mdash;should be run through melted tallow
and beeswax before put to use. After the tallow and wax has cooled on
the twine, the bridling may proceed. After the twine is in position on the
brush, run a little of the warm grease and wax over it. Thus a more durable
and more easily cleaned bridle is given the brush.</p>

<p>Imitation vermilions are considerably favored of late years, but they
fade after the manner of a late autumn twilight unless amply protected by
varnish. Given adequate varnish protection they show radiant colors and
wear durably.</p>

<p>The country carriage painter is no stranger to the vehicle, the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
heirloom, perchance, that comes into the shop with hubs split and shattered,
and axle grease filtering up through the cracks saturating the wood and
making it generally unpaintable. An old carriage painter advises this treatment
in order to cause the paint and color to dry over the afflicted parts:
First give the hubs a wash with gasoline or benzine, working the fluid well
into the cracks. Give plenty of time for evaporation to occur. Then with
shellac cut with a little ether, fill in the fissure. Next make a putty of
plaster of paris mixed with the shellac and ether. Into the fissures force this
mixture, keeping it clearly from the outside surface of the hub, as nothing
short of a file will level it after it has dried. Give the putty a nice, smooth
dressing off upon the filling of each crevice.</p>

<p>The business wagon occasionally contains a window glass that should
go in imitation of frosted glass. Take finely ground whiting and, with <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span>
raw linseed oil to <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> japan, mix to a rather stiff consistency; and then with
turpentine reduce to a condition to work easily under a camel's-hair brush.
Let the mixture be spread quickly and uniformly even upon the glass. Then
take finely shredded cloth and roll it into a ball and cover with a clean cotton
cloth and proceed to go carefully over the freshly laid on whiting, softly tapping
it, until the frosted imitation is brought clearly and prettily into relief.</p>

<p>A surface that has become dented by a blow from a hammer or other
blunt instrument can be remedied by so placing the surface that the dent or
depression will hold a little water poured into it, and then holding a lighted
taper to the water until the heat thus generated in the minute body of water
causes the wood to again assume its natural shape and condition. In denting
the wood, if a positive rupture does not occur at the edge of the depression
the strain of the wood has occurred in two distinct directions&mdash;inward
and lengthwise&mdash;and the reaction when it takes place will be two-fold. A
second way of treating such surface difficulties consists of boring with a gimlet
through the compressed fibres of the wood until the sound timber is
reached. This puncture will counteract the lengthwise reaction. Then
moisten with tepid water until the wood recovers its natural position again.
The bruise or dent with fractured edges is more easily repaired, as no reaction
need be feared, the pressure of the tool making the depression having
overcome the natural resistance of the wood; and destruction of resistance
results, as may be naturally inferred, in destruction of all reactive functions.</p>

<p>If the carriage or wagon painter at any time wishes a varnish to dry
without gloss he may dissolve 4 ounces of beeswax in turpentine and add to
1 quart of varnish. This, while not reducing the body of the varnish, will
cause it to dry without much, if any lustre. It will work from the brush
freely and wear durably. If only a subdued gloss is desired, use 2 ounces of
beeswax to 1 quart of varnish.</p>

<p>The window sashes in business wagons that are painted in some of the
dark fashionable greens offer a beautiful contrast to the body color if grained
mahogany color. For the ground color for the mahogany use white lead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
burnt sienna, and a bit of raw sienna for the toning ingredient. Putty, if
necessary, upon the first ground coat. Two coats should suffice to give a
dense, stable ground. Burnt sienna, wet in stale beer, forms the graining
material. Apply with a soft brush, wipe quickly out with a soft, fleecy
sponge, use the blender lightly, and the trick is done.</p>

<p>The finisher should never assume the responsibility of adding driers to
varnish. Varnish is composed of peculiarly sensitive and susceptible ingredients
responding to the slightest influences, good or ill, and the addition of
siccatives only tends to make the action of the varnish uncertain. It is only
for the time being that the driers unite and form a part of the varnish.
During the operation of applying to the surface the varnish forsakes or separates
the shop-added siccative, with the result that pitting and pin-holing,
along with other burdensome deviltries, are developed. No, shop mixing of
driers with varnish is not advisable.</p>

<p>My esteemed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confrere</i>, Mr. J. G. Cameron, makes public this worthy observation,
with <cite>Varnish</cite> as his medium of circulation: "Every varnish room
should have a window through which the direct rays of the sun passes during
the afternoon. It should be curtained and have a small slit or hole in the
curtain for a slice of sunlight to stream through. This slice of sunlight will
reveal the condition of the air within the room and tell the varnisher just
how much dust he will have to contend with that day. If this ray shows
that the air is loaded with magnetic dust, it would be well for him to sprinkle
well every suspicious place within the varnish room. Some days sprinkling
is not needed; such days as rainy ones or right after a rain storm. On windy
days, window sills and any place where the air is likely to drift through
should be wet down. But on magnetic days the floor and every place should
be well wet down. A varnisher's clothes should be also scrupulously
groomed off. The writer has varnished often with a damp 'shammy' wrapped
round his wrist and arm to keep the dust from his underclothing from troubling
him."</p>

<p>Beware of the black color-and-varnish that carries a dash of too much
color in it. Black of high or low degree, such as is used in carriage painting,
may be classed as a non-drying material. Finishing varnish applied over a
color-and-varnish containing too great a percentage of color is exceedingly
liable to strike into this improperly hardened undercoat and lose the beauty
of its lustre thereby. In carriage part finishing done upon the color-and-varnish
coat the trouble here noted should be guarded against.</p>

<p>Ornamental striping upon business wagons should never be done with
the heavy stripe. Retain the same style of striping throughout a job. Throwing
in two or three styles of line work on a job is an affront to good taste of
which no up-to-date painter should be guilty.</p>

<p>A fine old woodworker once told my lamented friend, Mr. C. E. Vader,
how to make a saw with which to cut block pumice stone. He said: "Take
a piece of band iron <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> or 2 inches wide and 18 inches long; put one end in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the vise and then get a sharp cold-chisel. Be sure to have it sharp. Slant
the chisel 45° from you and tip to the left and strike quite a blow. Next time
turn chisel to the right, or just try to cut some saw teeth in this iron. You
can cut and set them at the same time. Don't make teeth too far apart.
This will cut as much pumice stone as a well filed and set saw would."</p>

<p>In an essay on "How to Make Coach Varnish go Wrong," published
by a prominently-known varnish making firm some time since, this advice
was tendered: "Practice hospitality! Let everybody go in and out of your
varnish room freely. Don't have a small door cut in the large one, and
don't shut off your varnish room from the other rooms. Let the temperature
of your varnish room vary as much as possible. Under no circumstances
allow it to remain the same for two consecutive hours. Let it fall
far below 70° or rise far above 80°; but above all things, <em>make it vary</em>. In
the winter season let the fire go out occasionally, and be sure to select this
as the proper time to open the window to see what is going on outside."</p>

<p>One of the strong selling factors of a vehicle consists of a first-class interior
finish. A prospective customer, as a rule, is quick to perceive the
finish of the inside surface; and nothing tends more powerfully to cheapen
the looks of an otherwise faultlessly finished job than a slovenly surfaced and
finished carriage body interior. One doesn't need to insist upon the same
high standard of cleanliness for the inside as the outside, but good surfacing
and an excellent freedom from dirt, motes, etc., should be maintained in the
finishing of interior surfaces.</p>

<p>In the finishing of carriages in the natural wood, gum shellac should
not be used to fill up the grain of the wood. Shellac is of an entirely too
brittle nature, devoid of elasticity, to be used upon a surface subject to sustained
vibrations with accompanying violent jars and jolts. For first-class
carriage work shellac is good only when not used.</p>

<p>Another strongly recommended method of filling up cracks and fissures
in coach panels embraces the employment of equal parts of English filling,
dry white lead and whiting, mixed with equal parts of japan and rubbing
varnish. To this add <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> the quantity of rye flour paste, stirring the mass
into a thick consistency. This is applied with an old paint brush, and when
it has set and stiffened considerably upon the surface it is knifed in with a
broad-blade putty knife, and two days later it is rubbed down with a block
of pumice stone or a fine rubbing brick.</p>

<p>A putty for resetting glass in coach frames is made of 7 parts whiting
and 1 part white lead mixed to the correct working consistency in raw linseed
oil, adding a little japan gold size to furnish the proper drying quality.
If the putty is to be use upon black frames, darken sufficiently with ivory
drop black, instead of lampblack, and lessen proportionately the japan used.
This putty can be depended upon to remain in place and securely, hold the
glass in the frames.</p>

<p class="center xxlargefont">THE EASY WAY.</p>

<p>The average actor must rehearse the new piece several
times, and each rehearsal uses up half a day. Then he needs
the prompter to help him out with the first few performances:
and his anxiety, lest he forget, wears on his nerves and worries
the other actors and causes the manager to say things, and compels
a great many scenes of battle and sorrow not writ in the
play. Edwin Booth never needed the prompter, and he rehearsed
but once. He had it all in his mind so familiarly, before
he came to the stage, that he went through it without an effort.
He said he was lazy, and that was the easiest way.</p>

<p>We appeal to your laziness. Why not make business easy!
What's the use of worrying, and making mistakes, and doing it
over again, and getting rattled, and keeping the factory in a
turmoil, and having angry customers, and losing trade, and walking
up and down at night, and saying things! If you have the
right kind of varnish on the right kind of color your work will
go smoothly, your nerves will be in good condition when you are
an old man, you will get the reputation of being wise and good,
your funeral sermon&mdash;so long delayed&mdash;will be delivered with a
clear conscience.</p>

<p>Just think a little beforehand: that is all. We keep ourselves
well and happy by making varnish and color which have
no battle scenes in them. Come now: let us trade together, and
show the world how pleasant a thing is business&mdash;properly done.</p>

Mechanical Trades. Each Part has been prepared
by a Specialist who is Master of his Trade.

on any one of them information so thoroughly
practical in character.</p>

of the whole book, and this can be as truly said of
the Practical Instruction in Carriage Painting, and
also that in Sign Painting, which includes Painting
on Glass and various Metals and Textiles, as well as
on Wood.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Letter Patterns for Carriage Painting are now used by experienced workmen who want a time-saving
method, as well as by beginners who have not time to learn the trade by the old way.
They are cut from extra durable pattern paper, and are all ready for use when they reach
you. Each alphabet contains all the letters and the character &amp;.</p>

<p>To Paint Signs, you should place the letters in position on the board to form the desired words,
mark with pencil or crayon round each letter to get the outline, remove the pattern and
paint in the color.</p>

<p>To Make a Shade: After marking out the letter, drop your pattern as low as necessary and move
to the right or left, penciling round the right or left and bottom edges only; now, with a
straight-edge, cut in the corners on angle as shown in cuts of figure 5 and 6.</p>

<p>The following cuts represent some of the most useful styles, with sizes and prices of each alphabet.</p></blockquote>

<p>This brush is made on our full centre patent; it is brass bound,
and the greatest pains taken in the selection of stock and making.
It now stands at the head of this class of brushes, being especially
adapted to piano, car, and coach work.</p>

<p class="center"><b class="largefont">"The King" Patent Chiselled Varnish Brush</b></p>

<p>The following, written by one who is an acknowledged authority
on the subject of varnishing, will be of interest to those who want
the best brush made.</p>

<p class="center"><b>"THE KING" VARNISH BRUSH.</b></p>

<p>"It is seldom that we so readily commend a new tool as, in this
instance, we do the patent varnish brush of Messrs. John L. Whiting
&amp; Son Co., Boston, Mass., which they are now supplying under the
name of 'The King.' It consists of an oval brush bound with brass,
and having its centre well filled with bristles. The latter is a new
and certainly very desirable feature, as no accumulation of dirt or
varnish gum can find a resting place. The bristles are of the best
quality, possessing all the desired elasticity, and appear to be more
firmly held in place than is the case with many oval brushes we have
used. The bristles are evenly distributed throughout the brush,
and are not compressed into a solid ring or ferrule, around a so-called
reservoir for varnish or paint, in the centre of the brush. These
reservoirs have never been a success, and the absence of one in 'The
King' leads us to particularly admire it, for our experience teaches
us that a brush with a solid bristle centre will carry varnish better
and keep in better order than one having a central space or reservoir.
Besides this, such a brush will wear more evenly. The brush is
particularly adapted for varnishing large panels or gears, and well
merits a trial by varnishers."</p>

<p class="rightalignindent">
F. B. GARDNER.<br />
</p>

<p>If you are not using <b>Whiting's Brushes</b> give them a trial and
learn their superior working qualities and economy, over all other
kinds. For information address the manufacturers.</p>
